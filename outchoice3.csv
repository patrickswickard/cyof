4,Got anything else produced by Roger Corman? He seems to pick winners!,"If Mama Ramone gave birth to another one, what should she name him? Is Alphonse too provincial? Should she call him Ghislain instead? Let's reason this out.","There's no way some dudes as funny looking as the Ramones would have gorgeous women swooning over them in real life, right? Right?"

7,"""Springtime for Hitler"" is over. Is it hockey season yet?",Fraud is kind of old fashioned for me. Show me the newest innovations in organ harvesting instead!,I think that Bialystock was onto something. Even some younger women can agree there's something appealing about older women!

Sleep's for dreamers. I haven't slept in thirty days, man. Takes a lot of medicine to keep up this pace."""

39,A slender gal like Karen would have made an awesome cat burglar!,A little too skinny for sex work though.,Let's see something different. Barbie dolls are for babies...

52,Not enough tribbles! Could we maybe get something with penguins in it instead?,Actually I want to see all the tribbles! Give me something completely wacky to watch...,I thought this was going to be the one with the whales! Can I at least have something with a shark in it next?
53,The eternal dilemma: I can't decide if I'm more in the mood for Jean Cocteau now...,...or Adam Sandler!,Cats are great at always landing on their feet. Wonder how they'd be on skis?
54,Enough of Spain. Let's check in on Kenya and Tanzania!,"Cervantes is cool, but I'm a bigger fan of Lewis Carroll. Let's go down the rabbit hole...and maybe to a haunted house!","Okay, here's a niche request. Got any movies where I can watch two guys move a bunch of rocks around?"

142,"Show me more tense, stressed-out women please!","If you have two hours to kill, don't watch a Rivette film. Most of them clock in around three hours or more!",A Talking Heads concert is just the right length if you have some time to kill in the evening.

145,"Feeling the gay here. Send me over the rainbow, baby!",Um...got anything a little less gay?,Or at least with more gore?
146,Bad parenting leads to bad outcomes. Your kid could end up in a mental hospital!,"Or worse, a philosopher!","Or if it's a girl, she could end up swinging on a pole or being an artist model or something!"
147,That kid needs some better hobbies. Nothing too creepy or weird though...,That poor Antoine will never amount to anything.

156,Bob the Gambler has a nice ring to it. Much better than being known as Bob the Pervert or Bob the Jew.,"Great vibe, but would be even greater with some Cold War paranoia thrown in!",Bob wasn't cut out for heists. Maybe he'd be a better ad-man...

I wonder what his first full-length film would look like...,Those people were kinda trashy. Show me someone with a little more wealth and taste!

231,They shot a lot more than just piano players in the Holocaust...,"This was very...atmospheric. I can see why someone might be attracted to the dark glow of the mountains, or even the streetlights...",Shooting the piano player seems a step too far.
