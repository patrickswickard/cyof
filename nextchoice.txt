001
Dogtooth
(039_Haxan) | The dad in this makes me want to start my own cult. Anything available to give me tips on the occult lore for that?
(247_Tie Me Up Tie Me Down) | Confining and controlling someone is a pretty good way of showing you care, right? I'm in the mood for a love story next...
(248_What Have I Done To Deserve This) | More weird dental hijinks, please! Got anything with a pedophile dentist in it?
*****************************
*****************************
002
Shutter Island
(228_The Wolf of Wall Street) | I think I need a linguist to help me understand all those thick fake Boston accents!
(055_The Man Who Killed Don Quixote) | Lighthouses are cool, but what really turns me on is windmills...
(224_Lola) | More seaside antics, but fewer rats please!
*****************************
*****************************
003
There Will Be Blood
(030_Ieri Oggi Domani) | Wow, not a lot of women in that film. Got anything with Sophia Loren in it to clear the palate?
(086_Wings of Hope) | Too dry and dusty for me. Got anything in a damper setting?
(225_Stolen Kisses) | I wish I were drinking a milkshake in Paris right now...
*****************************
*****************************
004
Rent
(056_Delicatessen) | Landlords suck! You can't get a landlord much worse than the one in this movie, right? I mean, right?
(215_Made In U.S.A.) | This was very loosely based on an opera set in Paris, and moved to New York, right? Got anything where we go the other direction and take a hard-boiled novel in the U.S. and set it in Paris with some of the genders flipped?
(168_Mauvais Sang) | I love movies about blood-borne illnesses. Show me more!
*****************************
*****************************
005
Rock n Roll High School
(022_Dementia 13) | Got anything else produced by Roger Corman? He seems to pick winners!
(226_Bed and Board) | If Mama Ramone gave birth to another one, what should she name him? Is Alphonse too provincial? Should she call him Ghislain instead? Let's reason this out.
(035_Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life) | A Heroic Life) There's no way some dudes as funny looking as the Ramones would have gorgeous women swooning over them in real life, right? Right?
*****************************
*****************************
006
Parasite
(093_Handicapped Future) | Wow, poor people have it rough. How does it compare to having a disability though?
(139_Shivers) | Not bad, but got anything with actual parasites in it?
(049_Ivan's Childhood) | That kid was pretty stealthy! Bet his skills could have been applied pretty well in wartime...
*****************************
*****************************
007
Battleship Potemkin
(036_Grizzly Man) | So who would win in a fight--a detachment of dismounted Cossacks or an equal number of grizzly bears?
(041_Poison) | Okay, so now I have that "In the Navy" song by the Village People stuck in my head. Might as well roll with the homoeroticism...
(216_Antoine et Colette) | My attention span is still shot. Got anything else relatively short, preferably in black and white?
*****************************
*****************************
008
The Producers
(115_Red Army) | "Springtime for Hitler" is over. Is it hockey season yet?
(076_Crimes of the Future) | Fraud is kind of old fashioned for me. Show me the newest innovations in organ harvesting instead!
(024_Carol) | I think that Bialystock was onto something. Even some younger women can agree there's something appealing about older women!
*****************************
*****************************
009
Rabid
(157_Bob Le Flambeur) | It's probably best not to gamble with your health with untested treatments--or to gamble much at all, for that matter!
(230_Boyz n the Hood) | Sad that most people don't know, don't show, or don't care what's going on with mutagenic surgical technology these days...
(188_The Darjeeling Limited) | Wow, it's interesting how much a motorcycle accident can really mess someone up...
*****************************
*****************************
010
The Five Obstructions
(240_Day For Night) | Making a film is probably easy if no one is deliberately trying to make it tricky for you, right?
(250_Beware of a Holy Whore) | ...And it's nice to see how calm and collected filmmakers can be in the face of hardship!
(100_The White Diamond) | I suppose it's easier making a film than a blimp! 
*****************************
*****************************
011
Fitzcarraldo
(048_The Steamroller and the Violin) | Bet it would be easier to get that ship through the jungle if someone only had a steamroller!
(022_Dementia 13) | At least no one drowned in those rapids. Safe boating is no accident!
(106_Werner Herzog Short Films) | That was good but kind of long. Got anything by the same director, but maybe shorter?
*****************************
*****************************
012
My Best Fiend
(040_Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) | I'd love for someone to make a Klaus Kinski biopic with some old He-Man dolls. Got anything to tide me over until that happens?
(009_Rabid) | Good lord, what bit Klaus Kinski to make him such a nutcase?
(125_To Live and Die in LA) | I love Kinski's energy and impulsiveness. Too bad he never channeled that into being a federal agent and catching counterfeiters!
*****************************
*****************************
013
L'Age d'Or
(224_Lola) | The stocking scene was weirdly hot for something this early. I'm in the mood to watch some cabaret dancers now...
(089_Ballad of the Little Soldier) | Call me a monster, but I kinda laughed at the part where the little kid got shot!
(213_The Decline of Western Civilization) | At the risk of sounding like a punk, FUCK the bourgeois virtues and outdated sexual mores of our society!
*****************************
*****************************
014
Un Chien Andalou
(130_Menace II Society) | This movie gives me the strange urge to watch 1990s hood films and early surrealist films in an endless loop for some reason!
(134_The Hudsucker Proxy) | This had some pretty intense imagery in it. Got anything a little lighter? You know...for kids!
(174_L'Insoumis) | Too much eyeball trauma! You know who's a little easier on the eyes--Alain Delon!
*****************************
*****************************
015
Enigma of Kaspar Hauser
(061_Heart of Glass) | The chicken hypnotizer was pretty cool. So what happens if you hypnotize actors instead of poultry?
(040_Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) | I'm a sucker for true stories with unhappy endings. Got anything like that where the actors are a bit more...plasti?
(175_Four Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle) | Based on my viewing of this film, the Great and Powerful AI Algorithm thinks I would enjoy more movies about the fragility of innocence in the face of a complex and sometimes deceptive world!
*****************************
*****************************
016
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(233_Pontypool) | Dracula is fine, but what really scares me is babbling zombies in a snowstorm!
(145_Black Orpheus) | The count was looking pretty pale and sickly. I bet a trip to Rio would do him some good!
(025_I'm Not There) | I love the part where the count looks at the crucifix and tells Jesus, "Do your early stuff!" Oh wait, that was a different film...
*****************************
*****************************
017
The Master
(154_Johnny Guitar) | Not enough strong female characters in this one. I want to see something where the women wear the pants!
(189_Une Femme Est Une Femme) | Meh. Needs more strippers!
(229_Love on the Run) | I do have a soft-spot for films that feature a pathetic man-child though...
*****************************
*****************************
018
Nimic
(099_Jag Mandir) | I greatly prefer the sitar to the cello...
(077_Paint Your Wagon) | It just goes to show that sometimes two spouses are better than one!
(160_Daisies) | That was alright, but now I'm in the mood for some hot girl-on-girl scissoring action!
*****************************
*****************************
019
Dottie Gets Spanked
(052_Flesh for Frankenstein) | Watching kinky stuff in your formative years can certainly warp your sexuality. Speaking of which...got any horror films with lots of full frontal nudity?
(131_Friday) | Nothing takes the sting out of corporal punishment like chasing it with some THC!
(113_Once Upon a Time in America) | That kid should have tried bringing Dottie a charlotte russe cake with whipped cream instead of his amateurish drawings if he really wanted to get her attention!
*****************************
*****************************
020
Putney Swope
(245_The Tin Drum) | I know I should probably watch The Hudsucker Proxy next, but we'll put that off for awhile. Show me something with weird little dwarves instead!
(002_Shutter Island) | Some of that jive talk was difficult for me to understand. Got anything where the characters are from somewhere people talk normal, like Boston?
(004_Rent) | Selling out is the worst thing someone can do. Stay bohemian! Fuck The Man!
*****************************
*****************************
021
Fata Morgana
(139_Shivers) | Such beautiful scenery. Makes me want to watch something where people vomit parasites that turn other people into rapists!
(241_Soapdish) | Fata Morgana would be a great name for a soap opera character! 
(011_Fitzcarraldo) | A bit dry for me. Got anything in a damper setting?
*****************************
*****************************
022
Dementia 13
(151_Vivre sa Vie) | "Fishy fishy in the brook, Daddy caught you, now you're a hook-er!"
(166_Hiroshima Mon Amour) | I feel like I should chase this with a doomed love story, but I'm going to need to ease into it with some gruesome atomic bomb aftermath footage!
(037_Woyzeck) | Poor Billy never had a chance. I bet joining the army and some dietary changes would have cured what ailed him!
*****************************
*****************************
023
Fast Company
(234_Wittgenstein) | Drag racing is fun to watch, but you know what else is a drag? Wittgenstein's views about the limits of language!
(114_Spring Breakers) | Got anything with more booze/tobacco/dope/pussy/cars? Feel free to throw in some guns as well!
(170_Wings of Desire) | Those racers must keep their guardian angels pretty busy!
*****************************
*****************************
024
Carol
(058_Un Flic) | Poor Carol. She just needed some good-looking guy like Alain Delon to sweep her off her feet.
(149_Jules et Jim) | ...or maybe two good-looking guys!
(104_Meeting Gorbachev) | ...or maybe just some pudgy Russian dude with a port-wine stain on his head!
*****************************
*****************************
025
I'm Not There
(166_Hiroshima Mon Amour) | I think it's safe to say a lot of Dylan's cynicism came from being a product of the atomic age!
(125_To Live and Die in LA) | He definitely changed his demeanor and appearance over the course of his career!
(246_Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) | "Sleep? aint sleepin'... Sleep's for dreamers. I haven't slept in thirty days, man. Takes a lot of medicine to keep up this pace."
*****************************
*****************************
026
Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans
(186_Rushmore) | A film about dirty cops is just screaming for someone to make a stage play out of it. Didn't someone do that with Serpico?
(024_Carol) | Nicolas Cage's quiet and understated performance in this makes me want to watch something by Cate Blanchett.
(161_Funeral Parade of Roses) | And the obvious Freudian aspects put me in the mood for something based on Oedipus Rex.
*****************************
*****************************
027
Le Samourai
(094_Huie's Sermon) | Whether it's Bushido or the Bible, a man's gotta have a code!
(213_The Decline of Western Civilization) | The samurai may be all gone, but Western Civilization's not looking so hot itself.
(154_Johnny Guitar) | Enough with the samurai cop stuff. Time for a good chick-flick!
*****************************
*****************************
028
Kamikaze 1989
(067_Where the Green Ants Dream) | Alcoholic cops are almost as bad as alcoholic pilots!
(138_Peeping Tom) | Just the right level of lurid...but could we ramp up the sincerity?
(103_Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices) | This is fine, but needs more madrigals!
*****************************
*****************************
029
Cecil B. Demented
(152_Contempt) | It's fun getting a look at all the drama behind the scenes when films are being made!
(218_SubUrbia) | Good to see talented people with ambition. Sad to think how many just hang out getting drunk around parking lots...
(127_King of New York) | How about something with a few more crimes but less of the filmmaking...
*****************************
*****************************
030
Ieri Oggi Domani
(137_Black Narcissus) | That poor kid never stood a chance at being chaste with Sophia Loren across the way from him. I wonder if nuns have it any easier...
(088_Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World) | Enough pretty Italians. Show me some pre-meltdown Elon Musk bragging about how he's going to send people to Mars!
(114_Spring Breakers) | I have no doubt that Sophia Loren would fill out a bikini nicely...
*****************************
*****************************
031
The Maid (2009)
(114_Spring Breakers) | Sometimes getting away for a bit on holiday is all it takes to change your life!
(212_Les Carabiniers) | Barring that, you could just stay home and look at postcards...
(054_A Cat In Paris) | Or become a cat burglar. Probably a more interesting career path than being a domestic servant!
*****************************
*****************************
032
Rodin
(189_Une Femme Est Une Femme) | Balzac was lucky to be around French-speaking people, considering that his name sounds like ball-sack in English. Speaking of which, got any French films that end on untranslatable puns?
(210_British Sounds) | I like all the artist model nudity, but what would be really cool is if someone read some feminist Marxist texts to accompany it!
(033_Eiffel) | Okay, the French had some pretty good sculptors, but how are they at engineering?
*****************************
*****************************
033
Eiffel
(002_Shutter Island) | Towers next to rivers are fine. But lighthouses next to the ocean are even cooler!
(017_The Master) | Sure, the French can build towers out of wrought iron. But can they build titties out of sand?
(190_The Grand Budapest Hotel) | This movie makes civil engineers look pretty glamorous. Got anything that does the same for concierges? 
*****************************
*****************************
034
Joan of Arc
(055_The Man Who Killed Don Quixote) | Joan's army was tough, but could they take on an actual full-sized Spanish windmill?
(182_Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles) | Joan was a great warrior and leader, but could she properly bread a veal cutlet?
(134_The Hudsucker Proxy) | Just goes to show that sometimes good things happen if you put someone young and inexperienced in charge of things!
*****************************
*****************************
035
Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life
(183_Julien Donkey-Boy) | Gotta admit I'm a sucker for a film with a funny-looking protagonist.
(146_Orpheus) | But sometimes it's great when the very gay director just uses the prettiest dude he could find!
(135_Metropolis) | Actually, I kinda feel like just putting a couple of Serge Gainsbourg albums on and listening to those for a few hours. Got any silent films I could watch while I do that?
*****************************
*****************************
036
Grizzly Man
(148_The 400 Blows) | Some boys are into grizzly bears. And some will nearly burn their houses down building a Balzac shrine in their bedroom. Consider me the latter type!
(239_Madame Bovary) | So, ladies, would you rather drink arsenic or get ripped to shreds by a bear? I'd probably go with the arsenic, myself.
(143_Cleo from 5 to 7) | At least a bear would be a nice distraction from awaiting scary medical test results...
*****************************
*****************************
037
Woyzeck
(211_Le Petit Soldat) | Well, when the army sucks, maybe deserting is a better option. 
(098_Into the Abyss) | Downer ending, but he would have been facing capital punishment anyway.
(242_Kika) | That pondside murder-suicide would have made great fodder for a television tabloid show, especially if someone showed up to film it live!
*****************************
*****************************
038
A Trip to the Moon
(182_Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles) | I'm more of a homebody, myself, aside from occasionally running short errands. And I work from home... 
(057_Cobra Verde) | Why be a visitor to the moon when you can go to Africa and overthrow a king?
(194_A Married Woman) | Flying around in planes and rockets is nice, but don't neglect your wife!
*****************************
*****************************
039
Haxan
(066_Signs of Life) | Bet those witches could put on a pretty bitchin' fireworks display if they started going stir crazy...
(007_Battleship Potemkin) | I've heard witches kill babies, but Cossacks will do the same thing if given a chance.
(105_The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft) | I guess burning witches is fine if you don't have the option of tossing them in a volcano.
*****************************
*****************************
040
Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story
(054_A Cat In Paris) | A slender gal like Karen would have made an awesome cat burglar!
(151_Vivre sa Vie) | A little too skinny for sex work though.
(047_The Baby) | Let's see something different. Barbie dolls are for babies...
*****************************
*****************************
041
Poison
(015_Enigma of Kaspar Hauser) | At least those prisoners had each other to keep themselves entertained. Solitary confinement can be pretty rough on a young man.
(245_The Tin Drum) | The kid flying away reminded me of Peter Pan. Let's watch that next--or the closest thing to it that you have, I guess...
(197_Moonrise Kingdom) | The pastoral scenes were nice, but those juvenile delinquents would be better suited for adventures in the wild if they had been doing boy scouting instead of committing crimes!
*****************************
*****************************
042
Monsieur Hulot's Holiday
(220_Les Cousins) | Too lighthearted! Show me something with more misery, preferably in a rural setting--with some possible incest thrown in!
(240_Day For Night) | Well, everything around that poor guy that could go wrong did go wrong. That'd be a disaster if he were a film director!
(153_La Chinoise) | Holidays are for the bourgeoisie! No time for that nonsense until after the Revolution comes!
*****************************
*****************************
043
Munchhausen
(042_Monsieur Hulot's Holiday) | Lots of adventures to be had when traveling! Even a short getaway can be packed with action and (mis)adventures!
(047_The Baby) | I'm a bigger fan of Munchhausen sydrome by proxy. Got anything with a baby in it?
(221_24 Hour Party People) | When you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend! 
*****************************
*****************************
044
Lynch/Oz
(150_Hitchcock/Truffaut) | I love films with a slash in the title! Show me more!
(003_There Will Be Blood) | Oz is boring. Let's go bowling!
(058_Un Flic) | Let's follow the yellow brick road...and see if any cops tail us!
*****************************
*****************************
045
Titicut Follies
(069_Rescue Dawn) | Wow, conditions in that place weren't much better than in a POW camp!
(205_Two or Three Things I Know About Her) | Despite the name, this didn't have any actual titties in it...
(010_The Five Obstructions) | Pretty good talent show considering it was put on by nothing but inmates and staff. Some people can do great work when challenged by such limitations I guess...
*****************************
*****************************
046
The Bicycle Thief
(005_Rock n Roll High School) | This film taught me that stealing bicycles is rad! Show me some more fun activities for juvenile delinquents!
(052_Flesh for Frankenstein) | Antonio may have failed at being a provider for his wife and a role model for their son, but at least he's less disappointing than Frankenstein's monster!
(098_Into the Abyss) | Good thing they were in Italy and not Texas. There would have been no mercy, and some hangin' judge would have thrown the book at him...
*****************************
*****************************
047
The Baby
(098_Into the Abyss) | Any good social worker can tell you that's not a good environment for a baby. He'll be lucky if he doesn't grow up to end up on death row!
(242_Kika) | Adult babies are pretty transgressive, but I'm really in the mood for developmentally disabled porn star rapists!
(195_Pierrot Le Fou) | Isn't it a bit more normal for the person acting as babysitter to run off with the dad, not the kid?
*****************************
*****************************
048
The Steamroller and the Violin
(169_The Rules of the Game) | Enough workers, let's see how the upper class live...
(227_Arrival) | This would be more exciting with an alien invasion!
(095_The Dark Glow of the Mountains) | Moscow's pretty, but it isn't as pretty as the mountains...
*****************************
*****************************
049
Ivan's Childhood
(173_Quadrophenia) | Russians versus Nazis is fun, but what I'm really in the mood for is Rockers versus Mods.
(096_Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin) | Poor Ivan never got to see much of the world.
(030_Ieri Oggi Domani) | Very tragic! Good thing children are a renewable resource.
*****************************
*****************************
050
Bad Taste
(021_Fata Morgana) | More dust, less goo please!
(059_Stroszek) | And maybe some dancing chickens!
(072_We Are All Going to the World's Fair) | Gross, but honestly I've seen much worse on social media lately!
*****************************
*****************************
051
Blood for Dracula
(205_Two or Three Things I Know About Her) | The only way this could be cheesier is if they broke the fourth wall...
(005_Rock n Roll High School) | Dracula's groupies were pretty hot, but I wonder how they compare to women in thrall to the Ramones?
(012_My Best Fiend) | Udo Kier was probably a lot easier to work with when playing Dracula than Klaus Kinski was...
*****************************
*****************************
052
Flesh for Frankenstein
(172_Bottle Rocket) | Baron von Frankenstein had some pretty ambitious ideas. I love a man with a plan!
(124_Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) | It's always a good idea to keep it in the family I guess...
(238_Being Maria) | That Igor scene was pretty traumatic. If you got anything else like that to sit through, let's just get it out of the way now.
*****************************
*****************************
053
Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan
(090_Encounters at the End of the World) | Not enough tribbles! Could we maybe get something with penguins in it instead?
(243_Zazie dans le Metro) | Actually I want to see all the tribbles! Give me something completely wacky to watch...
(187_The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) | I thought this was going to be the one with the whales! Can I at least have something with a shark in it next?
*****************************
*****************************
054
A Cat In Paris
(146_Orpheus) | The eternal dilemma: I can't decide if I'm more in the mood for Jean Cocteau now...
(208_Punch Drunk Love) | ...or Adam Sandler!
(081_The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner) | Cats are great at always landing on their feet. Wonder how they'd be on skis?
*****************************
*****************************
055
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote
(091_The Flying Doctors of East Africa) | Enough of Spain. Let's check in on Kenya and Tanzania!
(177_Celine and Julie Go Boating) | Cervantes is cool, but I'm a bigger fan of Lewis Carroll. Let's go down the rabbit hole...and maybe to a haunted house!
(236_Bent) | Okay, here's a niche request. Got any movies where I can watch two guys move a bunch of rocks around?
*****************************
*****************************
056
Delicatessen
(007_Battleship Potemkin) | That meat looked really unappetizing. I'd mutiny if someone tried to feed me that stuff...
(021_Fata Morgana) | Cannibalism is but a mirage.
(204_King Lear) | I'm ready for something a bit more Shakespearean!
*****************************
*****************************
057
Cobra Verde
(047_The Baby) | I wonder what Klaus Kinski was like as a baby...
(045_Titicut Follies) | I want an army of Amazons to stage theater productions with, but I'd settle for an army of asylum inmates instead.
(123_The Wiz) | An army of Amazons would be great, but an army of sassy flying monkeys would be even better!
*****************************
*****************************
058
Un Flic
(126_Bad Lieutenant) | That cop could have been worse I guess...
(135_Metropolis) | Less cops, more robots!
(056_Delicatessen) | Less heists, more cannibalism!
*****************************
*****************************
059
Stroszek
(203_But I'm a Cheerleader) | Not sure if Stroszek or his friends had any cheerleader background, but a performing chicken could make a pretty good mascot!
(171_The Battle of Algiers) | Maybe Bruno would have fared better in the Foreign Legion.
(133_Killer of Sheep) | Why rob a grocery store when you can get a good honest job in a slaughterhouse?
*****************************
*****************************
060
The Rabbi's Cat
(184_The Royal Tenenbaums) | A talking cat beats a precocious genius child any time...you never age out of being a talking cat!
(142_The Accidental Tourist) | Too much Judaism! Give me something WASPier.
(133_Killer of Sheep) | Let's check in on a butcher shop--preferably kosher or halal...
*****************************
*****************************
061
Heart of Glass
(101_Happy People: A Year in the Taiga) | "I loved it!"
(109_The Thin Blue Line) | "It was great!"
(015_Enigma of Kaspar Hauser) | "I'm going to see it again and again!"
*****************************
*****************************
062
Early Short Films of the French New Wave (19)
(243_Zazie dans le Metro) | Those were great, but I think I need something different. How about a live-action cartoon?
(163_Latcho Drom) | Or maybe a musical interlude?
(018_Nimic) | More short films by oddball directors, please!
*****************************
*****************************
063
Lessons of Darkness
(050_Bad Taste) | Well that was bleak. I'd love to shut my brain off and just watch some exploding cannibal aliens for awhile.
(058_Un Flic) | I don't mind a little darkness, but let's make it noir-flavored this time!
(084_Queen of the Desert) | Got anything with Nicole Kidman in it? Preferably doing some imperialism?
*****************************
*****************************
064
My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done
(019_Dottie Gets Spanked) | Maybe Greek tragedies are a bit much for young people to watch in their formative years. At most they should be watching spicy episodes of "I Love Lucy"...
(067_Where the Green Ants Dream) | Forget the pizza. He should have asked for a plane.
(226_Bed and Board) | That kid got a bit too much into Greek tragedy. But at least he wasn't some goddamn weeaboo!
*****************************
*****************************
065
The Wild Blue Yonder
(176_The Nun (La Religieuse)) | Less aliens, more nuns!
(094_Huie's Sermon) | I can think of another man who came down from the Heavens to deliver a message to the people of this world...
(121_Plague Dogs) | That diving stuff was pretty cool. Makes me wonder how well dogs are able to swim...
*****************************
*****************************
066
Signs of Life
(009_Rabid) | Are we sure that poor guy didn't have any brain worms causing him to act like that?
(128_New Jack City) | These guys would have found more exciting ways to stay entertained in the hood. Just sayin'.
(145_Black Orpheus) | If you're prone to being stir crazy, stay away from military deployments and nunneries!
*****************************
*****************************
067
Where the Green Ants Dream
(204_King Lear) | I heard a rumor that there's some version of King Lear directed by Godard. That sounds badass!
(133_Killer of Sheep) | Do green ants dream of electric sheep?
(002_Shutter Island) | Aussie accents are too hard to understand. Could I get some fake-Boston accents instead?
*****************************
*****************************
068
Little Dieter Needs to Fly
(109_The Thin Blue Line) | I hate seeing people locked up unjustly...
(197_Moonrise Kingdom) | Whether it's a prison camp or a boy scout camp, sometimes you just need to get away...
(077_Paint Your Wagon) | Wouldn't it have been safer to tunnel out of the camp?
*****************************
*****************************
069
Rescue Dawn
(210_British Sounds) | I'm glad Dieter got out. I only hope someone can rescue southeast Asia from imperialism!
(192_The Departed) | Too many Herzog movies lately. I'm ready for some Martin Scorsese!
(036_Grizzly Man) | The jungle looks scary but at least there aren't any bears!
*****************************
*****************************
070
Kinetta
(247_Tie Me Up Tie Me Down) | Looking in on those weirdos was upsetting. Makes me want to take a nice relaxing bath, maybe with one of my scuba toys!
(051_Blood for Dracula) | Dracula's more sordid killings would be interesting to re-enact!
(043_Munchhausen) | I was going to suggest The Thin Blue Line after this, but it's not currently available in my region. Let's watch some Nazi-era fantasy instead!
*****************************
*****************************
071
Alps
(032_Rodin) | This plotline wasn't exactly written by Balzac. Just sayin'.
(008_The Producers) | Amateur actors doing micro-theater imitating people's dead loved ones sounds like a guaranteed sure-fire way to lose money, but you never know... 
(039_Haxan) | I can't tell if those actors were part of a business or part of a cult...
*****************************
*****************************
072
We Are All Going to the World's Fair
(074_Kinky Boots) | I bet some kinky boots would have gotten that girl some more social media followers...
(167_Night and Fog) | ...as long as she didn't go and say something stupid and anti-semitic!
(201_Elevator to the Gallows) | I love the suspense combined with an anti-climax. Could I get something suspenseful and a little more traditional Hitchcockian, please?
*****************************
*****************************
073
The Babadook
(206_Weekend) | I read that Babadook book too, but he never pestered me. Maybe he got stuck in traffic...
(087_Wheel of Time) | Some buddhists believe that everyone is reincarnated as a Babadook eventually!
(149_Jules et Jim) | Single parenting looks rough, so it's probably good to have a spare dude around in case things go bad with the first one!
*****************************
*****************************
074
Kinky Boots
(216_Antoine et Colette) | The right footwear can attract a young woman a better class of suitor...
(186_Rushmore) | You know what pairs well with red boots? A red beret!
(038_A Trip to the Moon) | If that shoe factory does well enough, they should expand operations...to the moon!
*****************************
*****************************
075
Titane
(046_The Bicycle Thief) | Everyone needs a good father figure...and you can do worse than a firefighter!
(063_Lessons of Darkness) | Even carfuckers don't deserve the death penalty!
(064_My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done) | I heard there was a lot of gender-bending in ancient Greek theater.
*****************************
*****************************
076
Crimes of the Future
(092_How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck) | I wonder how much those cool chairs would go for at auction...
(112_King Corn) | I've hard that high fructose corn syrup does wonders for digestion!
(200_Kids) | Cronenberg movies always put me in the mood for uncomfortable sex combined with viruses and parasites. Got anything to indulge me?
*****************************
*****************************
077
Paint Your Wagon
(065_The Wild Blue Yonder) | Polyandry, drunken debauchery, Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood singing? I need an alien to make sense of this stuff...
(136_The Red Shoes) | So do Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood do ballet as well?
(069_Rescue Dawn) | When I saw Lee Marvin was in this, I was expecting a little more...war movie action? Could we get something more like that?
*****************************
*****************************
078
Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris
(010_The Five Obstructions) | This wasn't even close to being a Dogme 95 film!
(136_The Red Shoes) | Less singing, more dancing please!
(017_The Master) | Lots of drunken sailors in Jacques Brel's best songs...
*****************************
*****************************
079
Betty Boop Confidential
(198_Trash Humpers) | Animated flappers are so outdated. I want to see some old people humping trash cans!
(034_Joan of Arc) | Short hair is a pretty good look on women though. Especially when they go full tomboy!
(148_The 400 Blows) | I wonder if Betty Boop had a difficult childhood...
*****************************
*****************************
080
God's Angry Man
(181_Paris Belongs to Us (Paris Nous Appartient)) | God wouldn't like communists and intellectuals!
(078_Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris) | Did Jacques Brel have any songs about televangelists?
(055_The Man Who Killed Don Quixote) | I have a soft spot for deranged old men!
*****************************
*****************************
081
The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner
(181_Paris Belongs to Us (Paris Nous Appartient)) | Are there any conspiracy theories about ski jumpers?
(072_We Are All Going to the World's Fair) | I hate winter sports. I'd rather find a way to have adventures in front of my computer screen!
(003_There Will Be Blood) | Even bowling is more exciting than skiing!
*****************************
*****************************
082
Invincible
(199_Bluebeard (Chabrol)) | You don't have to be strong to swindle war widows out of their pensions!
(074_Kinky Boots) | I love feats of strength. Got anything with arm-wrestling in it?
(129_Welcome to the Dollhouse) | So what happens if you don't have a brawny older brother to stop people from bullying you?
*****************************
*****************************
083
Herdsmen of the Sun
(136_The Red Shoes) | I heard that the tie-breaker for this competition is a dance-off!
(199_Bluebeard (Chabrol)) | Being a hit with the ladies can be fun AND profitable!
(023_Fast Company) | Having a great smile is one thing, but what women really love is a fast car!
*****************************
*****************************
084
Queen of the Desert
(177_Celine and Julie Go Boating) | Trekking through the desert is great, but haunted houses are more my speed.
(016_Nosferatu the Vampyre) | I bet Count Dracula would have given her a royal welcome!
(210_British Sounds) | All this imperialism just makes me want to put my fist through a Union Jack.
*****************************
*****************************
085
Salt and Fire
(118_Hotel Rwanda) | All this ecoterrorism was a good warmup. I think I'm ready for some full-on genocide!
(099_Jag Mandir) | Actually let's back down a bit and watch some colorful parades and costumes and musicians instead.
(151_Vivre sa Vie) | Sex work is probably a little safer than dealing with eco-terrorists, but not by much...
*****************************
*****************************
086
Wings of Hope
(225_Stolen Kisses) | I'd rather be in Paris than stranded in the jungle.
(019_Dottie Gets Spanked) | This needed more spankings.
(118_Hotel Rwanda) | If you're lost in the jungle, a machete would be a pretty handy tool. But if it's in the wrong hands...
*****************************
*****************************
087
Wheel of Time
(096_Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin) | This seems like something spiritual enough to inspire someone to pursue a life of adventurous travel!
(200_Kids) | Life is suffering, and the pleasures of the moment can lead to pain, and so the cycle continues...
(027_Le Samourai) | Less Buddha, more Bushido please!
*****************************
*****************************
088
Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World
(105_The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft) | Got anything with a longer title?
(039_Haxan) | Modern technology all just seems like witchcraft to me!
(184_The Royal Tenenbaums) | No actual Tenenbaums were interviewed for this documentary, but some of those interviewees had reputations that aged like milk.
*****************************
*****************************
089
Ballad of the Little Soldier
(212_Les Carabiniers) | Those kids were pretty young, but the Army can be a pretty grand adventure if you're old enough to enjoy it and bring back souvenirs!
(150_Hitchcock/Truffaut) | Bet Hitchcock could have made a pretty suspenseful film about child soldiers...
(232_Shoot the Piano Player) | Kids should be learning to play musical instruments at that age, not shooting rifles!
*****************************
*****************************
090
Encounters at the End of the World
(120_Jodorowsky's Dune) | Antarctica would be even cooler with sand-worms...
(069_Rescue Dawn) | Being trapped in a POW camp in Antarctica would be awful. Southeast Asia would be bad enough!
(157_Bob Le Flambeur) | Gambling would be a pretty good way to waste time when faced with those cold endless nights!
*****************************
*****************************
091
The Flying Doctors of East Africa
(025_I'm Not There) | Those doctors are lucky to get a Herzog documentary immortalizing them, but a Bob Dylan song would have been even better!
(193_Bande a Parte) | What's the point of flying around like that if you're not even going to do any crimes?
(009_Rabid) | Bet they see some interesting parasites in that part of the world! But things can be just as bad in Canada...
*****************************
*****************************
092
How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck
(095_The Dark Glow of the Mountains) | Bet the thin air would make it hard being a high-altitude auctioneer!
(236_Bent) | Chucking wood is great exercise, actually. A lot more fun than hauling rocks!
(146_Orpheus) | I hate when people read poetry too fast. No need to rush...
*****************************
*****************************
093
Handicapped Future
(241_Soapdish) | Too bad those kids aren't in some soap opera universe, where even decapitations can be overcome and brain transplants can be performed in restaurants!
(025_I'm Not There) | This is some bleak-ass Herzog. I need something different. Play me some Dylan instead.
(176_The Nun (La Religieuse)) | Actually I'm not done being depressed. Show me how bad nuns used to have it!
*****************************
*****************************
094
Huie's Sermon
(144_The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) | If you pray hard enough, you'll never need an umbrella to stay safe and dry!
(147_Les Parents Terribles) | I bet Huie would have plenty to say about bad parenting...
(091_The Flying Doctors of East Africa) | Thoughts and prayers are great, but having actual doctors show up to help people is even better.
*****************************
*****************************
095
The Dark Glow of the Mountains
(041_Poison) | So how does homosexuality work at high altitudes?
(001_Dogtooth) | Are there stray cats in those mountains? I heard those can be really dangerous!
(212_Les Carabiniers) | Those mountains are pretty scenic. They'd look great on postcards!
*****************************
*****************************
096
Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin
(135_Metropolis) | Did Bruce ever make it to any futuristic robot cities?
(050_Bad Taste) | I bet he never ran across any cannibal aliens either!

*****************************
*****************************
097
Echoes from a Somber Empire
(011_Fitzcarraldo) | Let's see some more Herzog...but throw in some Klaus Kinski to make it spicy!

(185_Desperately Seeking Susan) | I changed my mind. Got anything with Madonna in it?
*****************************
*****************************
098
Into the Abyss
(215_Made In U.S.A.) | Real life criminals are sad, bleak, and often a bit boring. Let's see something a little more noir-influenced!
(090_Encounters at the End of the World) | Why not just send death row prisoners off to life in prison in Antarctica instead?
(156_Rififi) | This documentary would have benefited from a catchy theme song. 
*****************************
*****************************
099
Jag Mandir
(145_Black Orpheus) | I love a good festival. Let's do Carnival in Rio next!
(232_Shoot the Piano Player) | Actually I need a break from color. Got any chiaroscuro for me?
(167_Night and Fog) | I can't think of anything better to chase all these colorful Indian festivities with than a Holocaust documentary!
*****************************
*****************************
100
The White Diamond
(001_Dogtooth) | I love seeing people get that excited about aircraft!
(204_King Lear) | Wait...there's a King Lear version that's directed by Godard AND has Norman Mailer in it as Lear? Why have I not heard of this?
(239_Madame Bovary) | Oh the humanity! I bet Balzac or Flaubert would have a field day making a story about these guys...
*****************************
*****************************
101
Happy People: A Year in the Taiga
(088_Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World) | I wish we could ship some of our more obnoxious pundits and tech bro messiahs off to Siberia!
(188_The Darjeeling Limited) | Siberia is a bit remote. Maybe just a convent in the Himalayas.
(211_Le Petit Soldat) | Those pieds-noirs who fled Algeria were definitely NOT happy people.
*****************************
*****************************
102
Bells from the Deep
(250_Beware of a Holy Whore) | As with Vissarion, Rasputin, or any other Russian mystics, beweare of a Holy Whore!
(113_Once Upon a Time in America) | I'm ready to sink in my couch and watch a few hours of Sergio Leone now.
(026_Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans) | Actually, got anything with dirty cops but without Harvey Keitel?
*****************************
*****************************
103
Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices
(235_Stop Making Sense) | Madrigals are nice, but I'm ready for a full concert.
(172_Bottle Rocket) | Actually I could use some Owen Wilson about now to clear the palate. Luke can come along too I guess...
(205_Two or Three Things I Know About Her) | Herzog docs often put me in the mood for Godard not-quite documentaries. Got anything that will thrill me?
*****************************
*****************************
104
Meeting Gorbachev
(127_King of New York) | So does King of New York outrank President of Russia?
(221_24 Hour Party People) | Gorbachev did wonders ushering in the declining Soviet Union to a new era. Wonder what he could have done for an ailing rave venue in Manchester?
(080_God's Angry Man) | No more godless communists, please. Show me a real man of God!
*****************************
*****************************
105
The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft
(051_Blood for Dracula) | Blood is thicker than water, but is it thicker than lava?
(217_Suburbia) | In the grand scheme of things, getting killed by a volcano is pretty fucking punk!
(136_The Red Shoes) | If lava flows over your shoes, they may be red for a moment, but not for very long!
*****************************
*****************************
106
Werner Herzog Short Films
(083_Herdsmen of the Sun) | How about some more Herzog, but less short and more smiley!
(155_Asphalt Jungle) | Or maybe a break from Herzog is in order. Sterling Hayden in a heist film might clear the palate a bit.
(070_Kinetta) | Or we could split the difference and watch some weirdos filming themselves meticulously recreating crime scenes for unspecified reasons!
*****************************
*****************************
107
Gates of Heaven
(156_Rififi) | I'm sad this didn't have a catchier theme song.
(028_Kamikaze 1989) | This film is so late seventies. Got anything 1980s flavored? Bonus points if it reminds me of Miami Vice!
(164_Ten Things I Hate About You) | "I hate the way your muscles glisten as you bury people's pets..."
*****************************
*****************************
108
Vernon, Florida
(163_Latcho Drom) | Seeing all the turkeys makes me want to see something at least partially set in Turkey!
(100_The White Diamond) | Bet you could shoot a lot of turkeys from an airship!
(144_The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) | Could I get close to the water but far, far away from the Florida panhandle, please?
*****************************
*****************************
109
The Thin Blue Line
(073_The Babadook) | The Babadook was framed!
(060_The Rabbi's Cat) | A talking cat would be a great alibi witness!
(090_Encounters at the End of the World) | Great documentary, but needs more deranged suicidal penguins!
*****************************
*****************************
110
The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. Macnamara
(238_Being Maria) | Lesson twelve: don't go into a hotel room alone with Colonel Kurtz and a stick of butter!
(010_The Five Obstructions) | Eleven concepts is a lot to keep track of. I think I could handle five at most!
(040_Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) | Someone needs to remake this with a bunch of G.I. Joe dolls...
*****************************
*****************************
111
The Killing Fields
(024_Carol) | Yeah, I'm going to need a chick flick after this one.
(122_True Grit) | I'd love to see a sequel where Dith Pran teams up with some crusty old lawman to bring Pol Pot to the Hague, dead or alive!
(140_Cosmopolis) | Pol Pot sucked, but let's check in on some of the rich elitist pricks that inspired his campaign of terror.
*****************************
*****************************
112
King Corn
(197_Moonrise Kingdom) | I wonder if there's some sort of merit badge for growing your own corn...
(211_Le Petit Soldat) | Is early Godard this corny?
(147_Les Parents Terribles) | Only terrible parents would feed all this processed food garbage to their children!
*****************************
*****************************
113
Once Upon a Time in America
(219_Housebound) | Sometimes spying on women through peepholes in the wall isn't the worst thing a person can do.
(185_Desperately Seeking Susan) | Madonna has been around long enough where she's considered nostalgia. Show me some stuff by THE material girl!
(112_King Corn) | I miss the old days when Coca-Cola still had real sugar in it instead of corn syrup...
*****************************
*****************************
114
Spring Breakers
(028_Kamikaze 1989) | Lots of very tasteful and understated fashion choices in this movie! Show me more!
(144_The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) | More color! 
(162_The Color of Pomegranates) | I SAID MORE COLOR!
*****************************
*****************************
115
Red Army
(113_Once Upon a Time in America) | Once upon a time in America...we had a team that could beat the USSR! Tell me more about the good old days, Grandpa!
(107_Gates of Heaven) | So...is there a special cemetery for hockey players?
(203_But I'm a Cheerleader) | Hockey is a nice manly sport! I bet it's a good way of curing the gay!
*****************************
*****************************
116
Cool World
(141_Bonfire of the Vanities) | That was a nice interlude, but I guess we can go back to the world of scheming yuppie scum!
(159_Jackie Brown) | Cartoon Kim Basinger is pretty hot, but she's got nothing on flesh-and-blood Pam Grier!
(096_Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin) | Too bad Bruce Chatwin never made it to the Cool World in all his nomadic wanderings...
*****************************
*****************************
117
Interstellar
(190_The Grand Budapest Hotel) | Just goes to show that it's always best to consult your concierge about travel times when setting an itinerary!
(103_Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices) | A bit too epic for me. Got anything with smaller stakes?
(032_Rodin) | Nicely apocalyptic, but I prefer my apocalypses with a side of radioactive pteranodons. What's the closest thing you've got for me?
*****************************
*****************************
118
Hotel Rwanda
(064_My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done) | Murdering people with swords or machetes is kind of an odd thing to do in our modern world...
(237_Last Tango in Paris) | Anyone who runs a hotel can't be all bad, I guess...
(021_Fata Morgana) | Are there deserts in Rwanda? My geography is pretty bad...
*****************************
*****************************
119
Everything Everywhere All At Once
(179_La Belle Noiseuse) | As the name suggests, that was pretty loud and chaotic. Bob Ross is a bit more my speed...
(228_The Wolf of Wall Street) | What have we learned? Always be honest with your financial paperwork. White collar crime can get you into trouble!
(222_Les Bonnes Femmes) | Knowing martial arts is good for young ladies dating strangers. You never know when you may need to defend yourself!
*****************************
*****************************
120
Jodorowsky's Dune
(087_Wheel of Time) | More sand please!
(043_Munchhausen) | Jodorowsky could probably do a pretty good job telling something a little more focused than Dune, like the adventures of Baron Munchhausen!
(159_Jackie Brown) | On the other hand, I really do NOT want to see Jodorowsky adapting anything by Elmore Leonard!
*****************************
*****************************
121
Plague Dogs
(053_Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan) | Those poor pooches were facing a pretty hopeless situation. Kinda reminds me of the whole Kobayashi Maru thing from a certain sci-fi series from the 1960s...
(020_Putney Swope) | I bet a clever advertiser could figure out some brilliant way to use experimental test animals to sell acne medicine
(230_Boyz n the Hood) | It's a rough world for a dog. Having a good human companion is almost as important as it is for a boy to have a good father figure...
*****************************
*****************************
122
True Grit
(149_Jules et Jim) | One confident young woman bossing two men with very different personalities around is an interesting dynamic...
(065_The Wild Blue Yonder) | Meh, needs more aliens.
(158_Le Doulos) | Vengeance can be a pretty powerful motivator!
*****************************
*****************************
123
The Wiz
(104_Meeting Gorbachev) | We're off to meet the wizard, the wonderful wizard of the Kremlin!
(178_Out 1) | I wonder what the rehearsals looked like when The Wiz was still in development before it hit the stage...
(128_New Jack City) | It's good to be The Wiz, but everybody's gunning for you, especially when there's a poppy epidemic...
*****************************
*****************************
124
Before the Devil Knows You're Dead
(131_Friday) | Drug debts can sure get you in a mess if you're not careful!
(137_Black Narcissus) | This movie was good, but decidedly lacking i horny, squabbling nuns!
(006_Parasite) | If you're going to do crimes, it's best to keep things within the family!
*****************************
*****************************
125
To Live and Die in LA
(108_Vernon, Florida) | Los Angeles seems like a fast-paced, violent place. Florida is more my speed!
(129_Welcome to the Dollhouse) | Living on the edge in Los Angeles can be stressful, but is it really worse than middle school?
(041_Poison) | Would you rather burn to death or go to prison? Well, what if it was a really horny prison?
*****************************
*****************************
126
Bad Lieutenant
(037_Woyzeck) | Some people handle stress very, very poorly!
(143_Cleo from 5 to 7) | I bet women can handle stress a bit better than...that! 
(155_Asphalt Jungle) | Uh, let's check back in on the criminals. They gotta be better behaved than the cops!
*****************************
*****************************
127
King of New York
(004_Rent) | The best thing about being King of New York is not having to pay rent!
(141_Bonfire of the Vanities) | Frank may have been a drug kingpin, but at least he wasn't a slimy backstabbing yuppie!
(166_Hiroshima Mon Amour) | I'd rather get laid in Hiroshima than rule in New York!
*****************************
*****************************
128
New Jack City
(192_The Departed) | I prefer my gangstas many shades whiter and with thick Boston accents, thank you very much!
(015_Enigma of Kaspar Hauser) | There's nothing gangsta about stabbing some poor weird feral kid.
(083_Herdsmen of the Sun) | All this toxic masculinity! Couldn't they just have a beauty contest instead?
*****************************
*****************************
129
Welcome to the Dollhouse
(196_Sois Belle et Tais Toi) | Dawn Weiner would probably have been more popular if she could just learn to shut up and be pretty...
(018_Nimic) | Poor Dawn. At least she didn't have any creeps stalking and mimicking her...
(029_Cecil B. Demented) | Hooking up with other outsider weirdos probably would have been good for her. Plus I bet she'd be good at splicing film with those long fingers.
*****************************
*****************************
130
Menace II Society
(221_24 Hour Party People) | Whether you're a gangsta in South Central or some idiot rave kid in Manchester trying to make an album, stay away from crack!
(154_Johnny Guitar) | I do love films that have a tragic shootout at the end!
(014_Un Chien Andalou) | This movie gives me the strange urge to watch 1990s hood films and early surrealist films in an endless loop for some reason!
*****************************
*****************************
131
Friday
(077_Paint Your Wagon) | Alcohol and drugs can be dangerous. One minute you've got a good buzz, and then later you wake up hungover and you've bought something stupid at auction...like a wife!
(032_Rodin) | I've heard some strains of weed can make a person more creative...
(076_Crimes of the Future) | I've also heard marijuana can be good for digestion. Is there any furniture that has the same effect?
*****************************
*****************************
132
Frances Ha
(107_Gates of Heaven) | If teaching kids dance doesn't pan out, she could always get a job in a pet cemetery!
(244_Holy Motors) | Too bad for Frances that someone already took the one job in Paris that was available for experimental dancers/choreographers...
(202_Masculin Feminin) | The retro black and white made me feel like I was watching a French New Wave film!
*****************************
*****************************
133
Killer of Sheep
(068_Little Dieter Needs to Fly) | Getting out of poverty in Watts seems almost as hard as escaping a POW camp!
(161_Funeral Parade of Roses) | Interesting peek at the lives of African Americans in Watts. Let's see what things were like for LGBT people in Tokyo in the 1960s next!
(180_L'Amour Fou) | Or we could look in on a small theater company instead...
*****************************
*****************************
134
The Hudsucker Proxy
(239_Madame Bovary) | I can see why a young person might want to move away from a place like Muncie to try their luck in the city!
(104_Meeting Gorbachev) | Sometimes putting a new person with radical ideas in charge can work out well, whether you want it to or not!
(163_Latcho Drom) | I know I should probably watch Putney Swope next, but for the moment at least let's listen to some gypsy jazz!
*****************************
*****************************
135
Metropolis
(160_Daisies) | Sadly this isn't even close to passing the Bechdel test. Show me something featuring female friendship!
(116_Cool World) | A bit disappointed--I thought this was going to be the animated one!
(250_Beware of a Holy Whore) | Got anything else German but a bit noisier and more modern?
*****************************
*****************************
136
The Red Shoes
(044_Lynch/Oz) | So what would have happened if she had just clicked those red shoes together a couple of times while saying "There's no place like home?"
(118_Hotel Rwanda) | I don't often say this, but...less ballet, more genocide, please!
(022_Dementia 13) | Don't ask me why, but I think a low-budget Psycho ripoff would be a nice chaser for this!
*****************************
*****************************
137
Black Narcissus
(202_Masculin Feminin) | Someone should have asked those nuns their opinions on current events!
(092_How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck) | Those nuns would have more time to fool around if they could read their daily prayers a bit faster!
(117_Interstellar) | It felt a bit claustrophobic in that abbey. Show me something where the characters travel a bit more widely!
*****************************
*****************************
138
Peeping Tom
(086_Wings of Hope) | That guy would be a very poor maker of documentaries about women!
(082_Invincible) | He needed to be less of a creep and maybe hit the gym.
(177_Celine and Julie Go Boating) | I'm fine with a bit of horror, but I prefer haunted houses to slasher flicks!
*****************************
*****************************
139
Shivers
(031_The Maid (2009)) | I feel bad for whoever has to clean up all that parasite vomit orgy mess!
(169_The Rules of the Game) | Sometimes people don't even need some disgusting parasite to make them run around fucking each other, though they might be more surreptitious about it if they aren't infected!
(181_Paris Belongs to Us (Paris Nous Appartient)) | Less body horror, more Cold War paranoia!
*****************************
*****************************
140
Cosmopolis
(248_What Have I Done To Deserve This) | Rich people suck! Show me some virtuous poverty instead!
(037_Woyzeck) | This film certainly had some questionable medical practices in it...
(247_Tie Me Up Tie Me Down) | Robert Pattinson is pretty, but is he Antonio Banderas pretty?
*****************************
*****************************
141
Bonfire of the Vanities
(033_Eiffel) | Bond traders are assholes. I'll take a good civil engineer over ten of those every day!
(224_Lola) | Even sailors are more tolerable than yuppies!
(233_Pontypool) | Which is scarier--the south Bronx, or rural Canada during a snowstorm?
*****************************
*****************************
142
The Accidental Tourist
(072_We Are All Going to the World's Fair) | Why travel the world when you can have adventures on social media in your own bedroom?
(093_Handicapped Future) | Travel sucks. If there's one benefit to being handicapped, it's that no one minds if you're a homebody!
(241_Soapdish) | I guess age gap relationships are fine as long as no one is secretly related!
*****************************
*****************************
143
Cleo from 5 to 7
(201_Elevator to the Gallows) | Show me more tense, stressed-out women please!
(180_L'Amour Fou) | If you have two hours to kill, don't watch a Rivette film. Most of them clock in around three hours or more!
(235_Stop Making Sense) | A Talking Heads concert is just the right length if you have some time to kill in the evening.
*****************************
*****************************
144
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg
(178_Out 1) | Singing for ninety minutes is one thing. Could they keep it up for almost thirteen hours straight though?
(127_King of New York) | I heard Christopher Walken has a musical theater background. Let's watch one of his films next!
(244_Holy Motors) | Enough prancing around by the seaside. Let's head back to Paris!

Black Orpheus

(124_Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) | I can't decide and I always have to pick. You pick the next one!
*****************************
*****************************
146
Orpheus
(123_The Wiz) | Feeling the gay here. Send me over the rainbow, baby!
(203_But I'm a Cheerleader) | Um...got anything a little less gay?
(052_Flesh for Frankenstein) | Or at least with more gore?
*****************************
*****************************
147
Les Parents Terribles
(045_Titicut Follies) | Bad parenting leads to bad outcomes. Your kid could end up in a mental hospital!
(234_Wittgenstein) | Or worse, a philosopher!
(179_La Belle Noiseuse) | Or if it's a girl, she could end up swinging on a pole or being an artist model or something!
*****************************
*****************************
148
The 400 Blows
(070_Kinetta) | That kid needs some better hobbies. Nothing too creepy or weird though...
(091_The Flying Doctors of East Africa) | That poor Antoine will never amount to anything. I certainly don't see him becoming a doctor or pilot or anything useful...
(152_Contempt) | Poor kid. Get ready though, there's plenty of heartbreak to be had even when you grow up and get married!
*****************************
*****************************
149
Jules et Jim
(016_Nosferatu the Vampyre) | How about instead of having two boyfriends, you just have one but he's a vampire?
(079_Betty Boop Confidential) | Love the song in this, but bet she'd be even more of a hit with the guys if her voice was a bit squeakier and her looks a bit more flapper-ish...
(088_Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World) | Jules and Jim and Catherine were pretty connected, maybe overly so... 
*****************************
*****************************
150
Hitchcock/Truffaut
(214_What We Do Is Secret) | Sometimes it's fine to be a bit sloppier than Hitchcock...
(061_Heart of Glass) | Did Hitchcock ever hypnotize his actors?
(218_SubUrbia) | I have pretty bad vertigo myself, so even getting on the roof of a convenience store would be pretty suspenseful!
*****************************
*****************************
151
Vivre sa Vie
(232_Shoot the Piano Player) | Who needs a piano player when you can dance to the jukebox?
(174_L'Insoumis) | I was waiting for some rich handsome man like Alain Delon to sweep her away, but this is not Pretty Woman. 
(005_Rock n Roll High School) | I wonder how many girls have turned tricks for Ramones tix.
*****************************
*****************************
152
Contempt
(217_Suburbia) | Pretty fancy place they were living in--anything else to watch for decorating ideas?
(140_Cosmopolis) | I save my contempt for rich people getting prostate exams in limousines.
(063_Lessons of Darkness) | Having to suffer someone's contempt is bad, but at least it's not death row!
*****************************
*****************************
153
La Chinoise
(129_Welcome to the Dollhouse) | Dawn Weiner will be first against the wall when the revolution comes. Down with the Weiner Dog!
(035_Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life) | So is Serge Gainsbourg considered Gainsbourgeois?
(192_The Departed) | All those little red books put me in the mood for some cranberry juice!
*****************************
*****************************
154
Johnny Guitar
(071_Alps) | I'm going to have to go find something to listen to so I can keep that damn theme song from getting stuck ib my head. Thanks, Fallout New Vegas! You pick the next one!
(097_Echoes from a Somber Empire) | I'd love to watch something with more crabs in it...
(169_The Rules of the Game) | When women wear the pants, they get to set the Rules of the Game!
*****************************
*****************************
155
Asphalt Jungle
(081_The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner) | Ski-jumping over asphalt would be a terrible idea!
(012_My Best Fiend) | I bet Sterling Hayden was better behaved on set than KlausKinski!
(060_The Rabbi's Cat) | Every heist team needs a talking cat!
*****************************
*****************************
156
Rififi
(185_Desperately Seeking Susan) | Needs more Madonna.
(223_God Help the Girl) | That "Rififi" song was kind of a banger, but Belle and Sebastian is more my speed...
(130_Menace II Society) | Or maybe some gangsta rap would be better!
*****************************
*****************************
157
Bob Le Flambeur
(236_Bent) | Bob the Gambler has a nice ring to it. Much better than being known as Bob the Pervert or Bob the Jew.
(181_Paris Belongs to Us (Paris Nous Appartient)) | Great vibe, but would be even greater with some Cold War paranoia thrown in!
(020_Putney Swope) | Bob wasn't cut out for heists. Maybe he'd be a better ad-man...
*****************************
*****************************
158
Le Doulos
(029_Cecil B. Demented) | No one likes a rat. Unless you're from Baltimore!
(014_Un Chien Andalou) | Snitches get stitches...but not in the eyeball!
(208_Punch Drunk Love) | Enough hard-boiled noir stuff. Give me a feel-good Adam Sandler film!
*****************************
*****************************
159
Jackie Brown
(175_Four Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle) | This movie passed the Bechdel test! Let's celebrate by watching one that will be a slam-dunk on that test!
(046_The Bicycle Thief) | Sometimes thieving pays off big, but sometimes it ends in humiliation...
(171_The Battle of Algiers) | How much are flights to Algeria?
*****************************
*****************************
160
Daisies
(075_Titane) | It's all fun and games until someone ends up with a plate in her head
(195_Pierrot Le Fou) | Aside from the war footage, at least no one actually exploded in the end!
(093_Handicapped Future) | Those gals recovered nicely from losing their limbs. Sadly, that wouldn't happen in real life.
*****************************
*****************************
161
Funeral Parade of Roses
(110_The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. Macnamara) | Not sure what lessons I'm supposed to take away from this. Maybe Robert S. Macnamara can tell me!
(083_Herdsmen of the Sun) | I can appreciate a man who knows how to apply makeup!
(097_Echoes from a Somber Empire) | Straighter and less Oedipal, please!
*****************************

162
The Color of Pomegranates

(245_The Tin Drum) | Gotta say the percussion in this was kinda rad...
*****************************
*****************************
163
Latcho Drom
(079_Betty Boop Confidential) | This was fine, but my musical tastes are a little more Cab Calloway...
(225_Stolen Kisses) | Japanese culture is also pretty fascinating...to a point!
(085_Salt and Fire) | If we ruin the environment through climate change, everyone is going to find themselves doing a lot of Roma-like migration...
*****************************
*****************************
164
Ten Things I Hate About You
(227_Arrival) | I hate the way you make poor travel decisions...
(071_Alps) | I hate the way you act just like my deceased father sometimes...
(196_Sois Belle et Tais Toi) | And I hate that you won't just shut up and be pretty!
*****************************
*****************************
165
Clueless
(027_Le Samourai) | Cher had a pretty strong moral code and she meant well, even if it got her in trouble sometimes.
(011_Fitzcarraldo) | Giving Brittany Murphy a glow-up isn't exactly as difficult as towing a steamship over the Andes!
(120_Jodorowsky's Dune) | I wonder what Jodorowsky's "Emma" would look like...
*****************************
*****************************
166
Hiroshima Mon Amour
(128_New Jack City) | I think I need to watch something a little more gangsta than this next.
(030_Ieri Oggi Domani) | Those two were a cute couple, but they're no match for Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni
(116_Cool World) | Okay this was artsy and all, but I'm ready for some cartoon titties.
*****************************
*****************************
167
Night and Fog
(057_Cobra Verde) | I would love to see Klaus Kinski liberate those camps with an army of amazon women!
(235_Stop Making Sense) | Holocaust documentaries always put me in the mood to watch a Talking Heads concert!
(191_Fantastic Mr. Fox) | Okay, I need something less depressing. Let's punch the whimsical button really hard and see something animated that was directed by Wes Anderson!
*****************************
*****************************
168
Mauvais Sang
(165_Clueless) | Neo-noir is not my cup of tea. Got anything written by Jane Austen?
(054_A Cat In Paris) | Show me more films about thieves!
(217_Suburbia) | That David Bowie song made me nostalgic...let's check in on the 1980s punk scene!
*****************************
*****************************
169
The Rules of the Game
(195_Pierrot Le Fou) | Is stealing a car against the rules of the game?
(044_Lynch/Oz) | The bear was nice. Are there lions and tigers too?
(051_Blood for Dracula) | Another good rule of the game: it should not be your custom to go where you are not invited!
*****************************
*****************************
170
Wings of Desire
(085_Salt and Fire) | All the angels in the world aren't going to save us if we screw up the environment!
(229_Love on the Run) | Let's check back in on that Antione Doinel fuckup. I can't imagine his guardian angel hasn't ragequit by now...
(165_Clueless) | Brittany Murphy had the face of an angel...
*****************************
*****************************
171
The Battle of Algiers
(158_Le Doulos) | No one likes a rat!
(216_Antoine et Colette) | Lower stakes, please. So is that poor Antoine Doinel kid doing well with the ladies?

*****************************
*****************************
172
Bottle Rocket
(138_Peeping Tom) | At least they weren't dumb enough to film their own crimes!
(156_Rififi) | Love the Mark Mothersbaugh score. A catchy song or two can make or break a film!
(053_Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan) | That Dignan was a good strategist, but he's got nothing on that Khan Noonien Singh fellow!
*****************************
*****************************
173
Quadrophenia
(231_Boyhood) | I do love a good coming of age story!
(183_Julien Donkey-Boy) | Young people need healthier hobbies than mopeds and drugs. Why not try wrestling or ice skating?
(219_Housebound) | Sometimes it's better to keep troublesome teenagers close to home so they stay out of trouble!
*****************************
*****************************
174
L'Insoumis
(208_Punch Drunk Love) | That was intense and sad. Can we get a love story next?
(191_Fantastic Mr. Fox) | Okay, so what's the vulpine equivalent of Alain Delon? I imagine George Clooney would do his voice...
(228_The Wolf of Wall Street) | OAS terrorists are pretty bad, but off-Wall Street finance bros are just rage-inducing...
*****************************
*****************************
175
Four Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle
(142_The Accidental Tourist) | Travel is broadening and is a good way to meet new people, even if you're cranky about it.
(080_God's Angry Man) | An angry god would not approve of these close female friendships!
(173_Quadrophenia) | Female friendship is great...but what I really want to see is Ray Winstone's dick!
*****************************
*****************************
176
The Nun (La Religieuse)
(111_The Killing Fields) | Well that was depressing. More depressing, please!
(132_Frances Ha) | So do young women still have it that rough?
(215_Made In U.S.A.) | I'd rather see Anna Karina in something more flattering than a nun's habit...
*****************************
*****************************
177
Celine and Julie Go Boating
(125_To Live and Die in LA) | Celine and Julie would make great detectives!
(184_The Royal Tenenbaums) | This was just the right amount of twee for me. Now I'm in the mood for some Wes Anderson!
(193_Bande a Parte) | Sometimes breaking into a house like that can have tragic consequences...
*****************************
*****************************
178
Out 1
(035_Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life) | Someone should set that Boojum letter to music...
(158_Le Doulos) | At least none of those co-conspirators blabbed to the cops.
(115_Red Army) | In the time it took to watch that I could have watched like four hockey games!
*****************************
*****************************
179
La Belle Noiseuse
(230_Boyz n the Hood) | Enough girls in the nude, lets get some boys in the hood!
(249_Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom) | That was surprisingly boring. This may sound like a weird request, but...less nudity, more watersports!
(137_Black Narcissus) | I'm going to need a lot of nun action to recover from all that full frontal nudity.
*****************************
*****************************
180
L'Amour Fou
(062_Early Short Films of the French New Wave (19)) | I like this French New Wave stuff. Can I get a sample pack to go please?

*****************************
*****************************
181
Paris Belongs to Us (Paris Nous Appartient)

*****************************
*****************************
182
Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles
(063_Lessons of Darkness) | I just watched a woman silently do chores for three hours. I think I have the attention span to watch an hour of burning Gulf War oil fields, mostly without comment...
(126_Bad Lieutenant) | So is it better for your mental health to hold in your emotions and let them all come out at once, or to express them frequently and dramatically?
(013_L'Age d'Or) | Needs more toesucking.
*****************************
*****************************
183
Julien Donkey-Boy
(060_The Rabbi's Cat) | That family was pretty crazy. Throw in a talking cat and you'd have the makings of a great sitcom!
(066_Signs of Life) | The Dad in this looks like he'd be a good film director. I wonder what his first full-length film would look like...
(207_One Plus One) | Those people were kinda trashy. Show me someone with a little more wealth and taste!
*****************************
*****************************
184
The Royal Tenenbaums
(159_Jackie Brown) | Wes Anderson is a pretty strong flavor. Let's do some Tarantino next for a change of pace.
(214_What We Do Is Secret) | At least Margot Tenenbaum wasn't putting cigarettes out on people's wrists!
(046_The Bicycle Thief) | It sucks when parents fail to set a good example for their children...
*****************************
*****************************
185
Desperately Seeking Susan
(180_L'Amour Fou) | Perusing the want ads seems like a good way to run across conspiracies and conspiracy theorists...
(170_Wings of Desire) | Madonna is just a material girl. Now Peter Falk...that guy is a true angel!
(042_Monsieur Hulot's Holiday) | Not bad, but needs more slapstick!
*****************************
*****************************
186
Rushmore
(161_Funeral Parade of Roses) | That beret would look great on a Tokyo drag queen...
(231_Boyhood) | I love a good coming of age story!
(092_How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck) | Fast talking can get you out of a lot of jams, and you could do worse than having Bill Murray as a mentor!
*****************************
*****************************
187
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
(020_Putney Swope) | It didn't seem like a good idea having that guy in charge of things, but I guess it worked out in the end!
(130_Menace II Society) | Piracy on the high seas really is a menace to society...
(044_Lynch/Oz) | I wonder if Wes Anderson's quirks can be traced to some seminal film that greatly influenced him!
*****************************
*****************************
188
The Darjeeling Limited
(116_Cool World) | Are there any trains that run to the Cool World?
(029_Cecil B. Demented) | Remember that if you start to overdose on Wes Anderson, you can always come down with some John Waters!

*****************************
*****************************
189
Une Femme Est Une Femme

(249_Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom) | Meh, needs more watersports.
*****************************
*****************************
190
The Grand Budapest Hotel
(018_Nimic) | Shorter and grittier, please!
(206_Weekend) | That hotel looks like it would be a good weekend getaway...
(141_Bonfire of the Vanities) | At least if it hasn't been totally invaded by yuppie scum!
*****************************
*****************************
191
Fantastic Mr. Fox
(038_A Trip to the Moon) | That scene with the wolf in the moonlight made the moon look like a nice place to visit.
(120_Jodorowsky's Dune) | Wes Anderson doing Roald Dahl is pretty tame. What happens if you let Jodorowsky have a crack at Frank Herbert?
(079_Betty Boop Confidential) | This was fine, but I'm more into old-school animation...
*****************************
*****************************
192
The Departed
(249_Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom) | Lots of toxic masculinity here. Got anything with a literal dick-measuring contest?
(026_Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans) | Dirty cops are kind of my jam. Got any more of the same, but set in New Orleans?
(182_Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles) | Got anything equally long but less action-packed?
*****************************
*****************************
193
Bande a Parte
(223_God Help the Girl) | Two guys and a girl would make a great band, but they'd probably make the girl play bass...
(179_La Belle Noiseuse) | Spending three hours watching someone paint a single painting makes me understand why someone might prefer doing a speed-run of The Louvre...
(126_Bad Lieutenant) | Weirdly enough, I'm in the mood for a good baseball movie after this!
*****************************
*****************************
194
A Married Woman
(134_The Hudsucker Proxy) | How ya gonna keep up down in Muncie after they've seen Paris?
(068_Little Dieter Needs to Fly) | I'll never understand dudes who like aviation more than women...
(082_Invincible) | A married woman is no match for a strong enough man!
*****************************
*****************************
195
Pierrot Le Fou
(147_Les Parents Terribles) | What kind of parents raise a girl who ends up getting mixed wup with gun smugglers?
(062_Early Short Films of the French New Wave (19)) | More French New Wave please...but shorter!
(008_The Producers) | Bet they'd have gotten off easier if they had stuck to white collar crime!
*****************************
*****************************
196
Sois Belle et Tais Toi
(006_Parasite) | Staying quiet is actually pretty important if you're secretly living in someone's house!

(034_Joan of Arc) | Nobody ever told Joan of Arc to shut up and be pretty...
*****************************
*****************************
197
Moonrise Kingdom
(076_Crimes of the Future) | A good scout never performs illegal surgeries!
(196_Sois Belle et Tais Toi) | Glad suzy didn't just shut up and be pretty like her parents wanted.
(189_Une Femme Est Une Femme) | That Francoise Hardy record put me in the mood for some French New Wave! 
*****************************
*****************************
198
Trash Humpers
(013_L'Age d'Or) | MAKE IT!

(178_Out 1) | DON'T FAKE IT!
*****************************
*****************************
199
Bluebeard (Chabrol)
(143_Cleo from 5 to 7) | If you're a woman with some time to kill while you're waiting on something, don't waste it flirting with a serial killer!
(036_Grizzly Man) | So what happens if you choose the bear instead of the man?
(078_Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris) | I wonder how this would be as a Sweeney Todd-type musical...
*****************************
*****************************
200
Kids
(023_Fast Company) | All the creepy virus-y sex in this made my skin crawl. Definitely not following this up with anything by Cronenberg. Maybe something nice and dumb with racecars...
(117_Interstellar) | Teenagers are terrible. It would be nice if a parent could just hit fast-forward and skip the awkward years!
(139_Shivers) | The 1990s HIV paranoia makes this squirmy enough. Imagine how bad it would be with fast-acting body horror parasites instead of AIDS...
*****************************
*****************************
201
Elevator to the Gallows
(140_Cosmopolis) | Too tense for me. Something with a "Limousine Ride to a Haircut" sounds more my speed.
(038_A Trip to the Moon) | Or maybe a Rocket to the Moon would be more ambitious and inspirational.
(138_Peeping Tom) | It's all fun and games until someone finds the dead bodies and/or photographic evidence you carelessly left laying around!
*****************************
*****************************

*****************************
203
But I'm a Cheerleader
(226_Bed and Board) | Okay, I'm straight now. Back to unsatisfactory heterosexual relationships!
(048_The Steamroller and the Violin) | I heard having a good blue-collar working man role model in one's childhood does wonders for keeping away the gay!
(062_Early Short Films of the French New Wave (19)) | Watching some early French New Wave shorts is a good way to figure out gender-appropriate ways of behaving!
*****************************
*****************************
204
King Lear
(034_Joan of Arc) | That was...a bit abstract. Could we maybe see a meat-and-potatoes story about some historical figure instead?
(102_Bells from the Deep) | It would be interesting seeing Norman Mailer try to play Russian faith healer Vissarion...
(028_Kamikaze 1989) | I was hoping for more outrageous fashion stuff from a film made in the late 1980s...
*****************************
*****************************
205
Two or Three Things I Know About Her
(187_The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) | Some people think Godard jumped the shark with this one...
(168_Mauvais Sang) | Being a prostitute as your fun-money side hustle while your husband is at work seems like a sure way to pick up a blood-borne illness!
(068_Little Dieter Needs to Fly) | Sometimes people can get so trapped in their gender roles it can feel like a concentration camp!
*****************************
*****************************
206
Weekend
(124_Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) | If you're going to kill your parents as part of some harebrained scheme to get your hands on their money, at least do it by accident!
(108_Vernon, Florida) | I wonder how the traffic is in the Florida panhandle this time of year...
(016_Nosferatu the Vampyre) | Cannibalism is a bit much. Doesn't anyone just do plain old vampirism anymore?
*****************************
*****************************
207
One Plus One
(209_Tout Va Bien) | Whether we're talking music or meat, it's always interesting seeing how the sausage is made!
(198_Trash Humpers) | I think a Rolling Stones documentary now would probably be just a bunch of senior citizens humping trash.
(102_Bells from the Deep) | Mick Jagger is charismatic, but he's no Vissarion!
*****************************
*****************************
208
Punch Drunk Love
(014_Un Chien Andalou) | It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye!
(173_Quadrophenia) | Impulsive man-child with big dreams? Someone give that man a moped!
(045_Titicut Follies) | Poor anger management is a good way to end up locked away in a mental hospital.
*****************************
*****************************
209
Tout Va Bien
(246_Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) | Jane Fonda seemed a bit stressed there after her experiences covering that strike...
(085_Salt and Fire) | Wildcat strikes are a gateway drug to sabotage and eco-terrorism!
(107_Gates of Heaven) | At least it was a sausage factory and not a pet cemetery!

British Sounds
(133_Killer of Sheep) | The factory sounds from the start of this movie are a treat for the ears. I wonder what a slaughterhouse would sound like...
(160_Daisies) | Love the chaotic parts. Got anything with really messy eaters?
(057_Cobra Verde) | After watching this, I'm convinced that the Dahomey Amazons would benefit from having a labor union!
*****************************
*****************************
211
Le Petit Soldat
(100_The White Diamond) | So did the paratroopers in Algeria ever jump out of blimps?
(042_Monsieur Hulot's Holiday) | This had so much potential for slapstick hijinks but never delivered
(111_The Killing Fields) | Okay, the OAS suck, but they got nothing on the Khmer Rouge...
*****************************
*****************************
212
Les Carabiniers
(222_Les Bonnes Femmes) | It's always heartwarming to see two creepy French idiots somehow manage to be a hit with the ladies!
(115_Red Army) | Forget the Army, just join a hockey team instead!
(214_What We Do Is Secret) | If you're an unskilled young person, there are two places always willing to hire fuckups and train them up to do something slightly better: the Army and fledgling punk rock bands!
*****************************
*****************************
213
The Decline of Western Civilization
(089_Ballad of the Little Soldier) | Those young punks could use some discipline...bet the army would sort them out!
(081_The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner) | Wonder what the distance record is for the longest stage-dive?
(059_Stroszek) | Wisconsin seems like a pretty good place to travel to watch the decline of western civilization up close!
*****************************
*****************************
214
What We Do Is Secret
(017_The Master) | That Germs burn thing would be a great idea for cult initiation!
(084_Queen of the Desert) | You know what's really punk? British imperialism! (Okay, I guess that's not very punk at all but that's what's next!)
(087_Wheel of Time) | Love the Germs logo. Nice and round--reminds me a bit of a mandala...
*****************************
*****************************
215
Made In U.S.A.
(122_True Grit) | I do love films with a strong young lady as protagonist!
(056_Delicatessen) | I like Godard's "Weekend" better. Show me something with more despicable people, some clowning around, and a bit of cannibalism!
(142_The Accidental Tourist) | Travel seems like a pain and inconvenience. They could have avoided a lot of this mess if they had just stayed in Paris.
*****************************
*****************************
216
Antoine et Colette
(103_Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices) | Needs more madrigals.
(187_The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) | It's nice seeing a man pursue something he's passionate about, whether it's a girl or a shark!
(019_Dottie Gets Spanked) | Maybe Antoine should have written Colette a fan letter...
*****************************
*****************************
217
Suburbia
(059_Stroszek) | Maybe those punks would have fared better in Wisconsin!
(121_Plague Dogs) | Those stray dogs looked pretty ragged. Wonder what their story is...
(101_Happy People: A Year in the Taiga) | In Soviet Russia, hooligans like this would have been shipped off to Siberia!
*****************************
*****************************
218
SubUrbia
(080_God's Angry Man) | I think God would be angry at the boorishness of most of these slackers and backsliders!
(105_The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft) | Probably better off dying in a volcano than on the roof of a convenience store...
(172_Bottle Rocket) | Those young men need to come up with a solid plan for breaking out of their rut and making it big!
*****************************
*****************************
219
Housebound
(213_The Decline of Western Civilization) | An ankle bracelet is the ultimate punk accessory!
(049_Ivan's Childhood) | Kids like Eugene who are good at mechanics and sneaking around would be great in the Army!
(206_Weekend) | Better being housebound than being stuck in traffic for ages and ages!
*****************************
*****************************
220
Les Cousins
(207_One Plus One) | This didn't do it for me. Maybe a rockumentary would be more my speed...
(219_Housebound) | Living near family members can be stressful, especially when your neighbors are also weirdos!
(199_Bluebeard (Chabrol)) | Got anything else by Chabrol? Preferably with some serial murders...
*****************************
*****************************
221
24 Hour Party People
(171_The Battle of Algiers) | It's a bit inspiring to see someone stick to their ideals, even if it doesn't personally go well for them!
(157_Bob Le Flambeur) | Glad Tony Wilson was willing to take a gamble on Manchester music. I love a gambling man!
(234_Wittgenstein) | Well, we found out what Boethius would think about the Madchester scene, but what about Ludwig Wittgenstein?
*****************************
*****************************
222
Les Bonnes Femmes
(174_L'Insoumis) | Why would those women settle for hanging out with those two childish dopes and a killer when they could be hooking up with Alain Delon?
(209_Tout Va Bien) | Better off working in an appliance store than a sausage factory!
(007_Battleship Potemkin) | Hopefully none of those women will be pushing a baby carriage any time soon...especially down the Odessa Steps!
*****************************
*****************************
223
God Help the Girl
(121_Plague Dogs) | When I saw Belle and Sebastian were involved, I got excited. but not a Saint Bernard in sight. Got anything with actual dogs?
(207_One Plus One) | Indie Rock is fine, but I still prefer the Stones.
(110_The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. Macnamara) | That main dweeb reminded me of someone. Maybe one of those IBM whiz kids...
*****************************
*****************************
224
Lola
(106_Werner Herzog Short Films) | Enough showgirls. I want something short, German, and weird.
(148_The 400 Blows) | Hope that poor neighbor girl doesn't get put into juvie after running away, or we could have the makings of an Antoinette Doinel!
(050_Bad Taste) | Some cannibal aliens would really spice this film up!
*****************************
*****************************
225
Stolen Kisses
(237_Last Tango in Paris) | So where does Last Tango in Paris fit in with the Antoine Doinel films? Is it before or after this one?
(033_Eiffel) | All these films set in Paris are great, but what's the deal with that big TV tower thing we keep seeing in the background?
(150_Hitchcock/Truffaut) | Alright, Truffaut is honestly pretty charming. What did he think of Hitchcock?
*****************************
*****************************
226
Bed and Board
(026_Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans) | I bet Antoine Doinel would be uniquely bad as a police officer...
(110_The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. Macnamara) | What have we learned here? Well, probably not as much as we could have learned from the Vietnam War...
(122_True Grit) | I can't believe Antoine Doinel still has both his eyes and all of his fingers after all the trouble he manages to get into on the job and off!
*****************************
*****************************
227
Arrival
(191_Fantastic Mr. Fox) | Enough smoke aliens, show me some quirky animated foxes!
(004_Rent) | Using mahjong with those aliens was dangerous enough. Wonder how badly things would have gone if they would have taught them Monopoly...
(231_Boyhood) | Pretty sad to know your kid won't make it to their thirteenth birthday. Just goes to show what an ambitious leap of faith Linklater made with his child actors...
*****************************
*****************************
228
The Wolf of Wall Street
(153_La Chinoise) | Those capitalist pigs will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes!
(220_Les Cousins) | Jonah Hill's character marrying his cousin sounds like kind of a bad idea...but I know cousins can be pretty close sometimes.
(086_Wings of Hope) | After such a dramatic crash, someone needs to go back and sort through the wreckage.
*****************************
*****************************
229
Love on the Run
(003_There Will Be Blood) | Sometimes it's nice to catch up with someone from your past, especially if they're up for getting a milkshake or going bowling!
(053_Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan) | You know, this kind of reminds me of that Star Trek TNG episode "Shades of Gray" where Riker gets infected by the alien parasite and the only way to save him is to force him to relive his memories in the form of clips from earlier episodes!
(073_The Babadook) | This would make a great children's book! (Or at least you could do worse...)
*****************************
*****************************
230
Boyz n the Hood
(194_A Married Woman) | Glad to see Tre get the condom talk from his dad. Not a good idea to go carelessly knocking women up!
(013_L'Age d'Or) | Got anything else with a kid being shot for stupid reasons?
(108_Vernon, Florida) | Why do a drive-by when you can go turkey hunting instead?
*****************************
*****************************
231
Boyhood
(218_SubUrbia) | Please tell me that kid doesn't just end up back in his hometown standing around the convenience store parking lot after he graduates...
(246_Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) | Patricia Arquette looked pretty frazzled. Bet she could have used a few sips of sedative-spiked gazpacho...
(131_Friday) | Linklater should know it's all fun and games until they grow up and discover drugs and turn into slackers...
*****************************
*****************************
232
Shoot the Piano Player
(167_Night and Fog) | They shot a lot more than just piano players in the Holocaust...
(095_The Dark Glow of the Mountains) | This was very...atmospheric. I can see why someone might be attracted to the dark glow of the mountains, or even the streetlights...
(048_The Steamroller and the Violin) | Shooting the piano player seems a step too far. Could we maybe just bully the violinist instead?
*****************************
*****************************
233
Pontypool
(078_Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris) | Nicely done. This calls for a celebration in the form of weirdly staged Jacques Brel songs!
(153_La Chinoise) | They should have been using that radio station to broadcast Maoist propaganda!
(065_The Wild Blue Yonder) | They did a good job fending off a siege of demented Canadians. I wonder how they'd do against an invasion of Brad Dourif aliens...
*****************************
*****************************
234
Wittgenstein
(242_Kika) | "Que heavy eres, Ludwig!"
(165_Clueless) | I bet Cher Horowitz would have some glib answers to some of the questions posed by Wittgenstein!
(119_Everything Everywhere All At Once) | All this philosophizing really makes me want a bagel.
*****************************
*****************************
235
Stop Making Sense
(112_King Corn) | Keep eating a corn syrup heavy diet, David, and eventually you'll fit into that suit!
(222_Les Bonnes Femmes) | "Psycho Killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?"
(209_Tout Va Bien) | So were all those roadies and stagehands unionized?
*****************************
*****************************
236
Bent
(049_Ivan's Childhood) | Welp, that was uplifting. Maybe we could watch something a little more kid-friendly instead?
(106_Werner Herzog Short Films) | I need something different. German is fine, but maybe shorter and a little more uplifting?
(031_The Maid (2009)) | Seeing them move those rocks back and forth is a good reminder that endless tidying for others can be bad for your mental health.
*****************************
*****************************
237
Last Tango in Paris
(097_Echoes from a Somber Empire) | Welp. At least there was no actual cannibalism.
(238_Being Maria) | That "butter" scene was kind of intense. I wonder what that was like to film...
(071_Alps) | I bet Brando's character could have used some sort of theatrical grievance counseling to cope with his wife's death...
*****************************
*****************************
238
Being Maria
(168_Mauvais Sang) | Lots of bad blood on that film set.
(201_Elevator to the Gallows) | I'd rather be trapped in an elevator than stuck in a room with Brando and Bertolucci.
(075_Titane) | Let's keep up the theme of bad things happening to bisexual young women...
*****************************
*****************************
239
Madame Bovary
(102_Bells from the Deep) | Can faith healers cure gangrene?
(176_The Nun (La Religieuse)) | Drinking poison seemed a bit dramatic. Couldn't she just have joined a nunnery?
(066_Signs of Life) | Setting off fireworks can be good stress relief too!
*****************************
*****************************
240
Day For Night
(155_Asphalt Jungle) | Nice seeing how everyone on a film set has a specialty, and if things go according to plan everything pays off like a lucrative jewel heist!
(190_The Grand Budapest Hotel) | I'd love to take a look behind the scenes at a fancy hotel next!
(186_Rushmore) | I bet there's plenty of drama to be seen if you take a close look at fancy private schools as well...
*****************************
*****************************
241
Soapdish
(043_Munchhausen) | Soap opera plots can get pretty crazy. But sometimes eighteenth century literature can be even crazier!
(064_My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done) | Nothing like a sword or knife attack on a relative by an unhinged person to liven up a plotline!
(183_Julien Donkey-Boy) | Elisabeth Shue's character grew up pretty well-adjusted despite having an absent mother. I'm sure some other families don't fare that well...
*****************************
*****************************
242
Kika
(188_The Darjeeling Limited) | The pervert sex maniac brother was a pretty extreme example, but it's pretty common to have difficult siblings...
(006_Parasite) | Sometimes it's good to peek in on what other people are doing, but maybe it's best not to get too involved...
(099_Jag Mandir) | As weird as it is, this movie is so colorful and visually stimulating. More along those lines, please!
*****************************
*****************************
243
Zazie dans le Metro
(117_Interstellar) | If I were that kid's parent, I'd go into hibernation and see if she grew out of that obnoxiousness!
(233_Pontypool) | It's all fun and games when most of the city loses their minds and hijinks ensue--until they start babbling nonsense and vomiting blood!
(132_Frances Ha) | Nice to see a young lady having fun running around the streets of Paris!
*****************************
*****************************
244
Holy Motors
(164_Ten Things I Hate About You) | "I hate the way you crawl out of sewers, and the way you cut your hair. I hate when you bite people's fingers off and make everybody stare!"
(111_The Killing Fields) | Those limousines are symbols of western decadence, and they'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes!
(223_God Help the Girl) | Seeing someone act as a one-man guerrilla theater company is pretty inspiring. Maybe I should start my own band!
*****************************
*****************************
245
The Tin Drum
(012_My Best Fiend) | I'm actually really glad Klaus Kinski was not in this movie...
(027_Le Samourai) | Watching that kid for three hours was not easy on the eyes. Time for some Alain Delon!
(237_Last Tango in Paris) | Enough uncomfortable sex scenes with young actors! Let's watch something wholesome, maybe with some music and dancing!
*****************************
*****************************
246
Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown
(229_Love on the Run) | Pepa's husband was kind of a shithead. Speaking of which, let's check back in on what Antoine Doinel is doing!
(023_Fast Company) | The car and motorcycle chase at the end of this gives me the need for speed!
(240_Day For Night) | Nervous breakdowns and love affairs can probably complicate film productions in unexpected and unpleasant ways...
*****************************
*****************************
247
Tie Me Up Tie Me Down
(170_Wings of Desire) | Antonio Banderas has the face of an angel...but he's no Peter Falk!
(031_The Maid (2009)) | It would be nice to have a maid for those times that you're too tied up to do any tidying!
(243_Zazie dans le Metro) | This was a bit too slow-paced and contemplative for my taste. Got anything with a little more zip?
*****************************
*****************************
248
What Have I Done To Deserve This
(193_Bande a Parte) | Sometimes when people accidentally kill relatives they don't get off nearly so easy though...
(101_Happy People: A Year in the Taiga) | I hope the grandma and the dope-slinging son have a happier life in a rural setting!
(094_Huie's Sermon) | I have a feeling God would be angry at a lot of the things that went on in this film!
*****************************
*****************************
249
Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom
(082_Invincible) | The dick-measuring contest in this taught me that everyone across the political spectrum, from leftist punks to Nazis, appreciates a big strong virile man!
(248_What Have I Done To Deserve This) | Were all of Almodovar's early films this weird?
(074_Kinky Boots) | Really loved the fashion in this movie, but what those girls really needed were some quality footwear!
*****************************
*****************************
250
Beware of a Holy Whore
(162_The Color of Pomegranates) | That was somehow...very German. Got anything more Armenian-flavored?
(152_Contempt) | Making a film can be pretty stressful on people's relationships.
(198_Trash Humpers) | But a DIY project with friends who share similar niche interests, can lead to a good time for all!
*****************************
