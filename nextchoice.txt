001
Dogtooth
(039_Haxan) | The dad in this makes me want to start my own cult. Anything available to give me tips on the occult lore for that?
(247_Tie Me Up Tie Me Down) | Confining and controlling someone is a pretty good way of showing you care, right? I'm in the mood for a love story next...
(248_What Have I Done To Deserve This) | More weird dental hijinks, please! Got anything with a pedophile dentist in it?
*****************************
*****************************
002
Shutter Island
(228_The Wolf of Wall Street) | I think I need a linguist to help me understand all those thick fake Boston accents!
(055_The Man Who Killed Don Quixote) | Lighthouses are cool, but what really turns me on is windmills...
(224_Lola) | More seaside antics, but fewer rats please!
*****************************
*****************************
003
There Will Be Blood
(030_Ieri Oggi Domani) | Wow, not a lot of women in that film. Got anything with Sophia Loren in it to clear the palate?
(086_Wings of Hope) | Too dry and dusty for me. Got anything in a damper setting?
(225_Stolen Kisses) | I wish I were drinking a milkshake in Paris right now...
*****************************
*****************************
004
Rent
(056_Delicatessen) | Landlords suck! You can't get a landlord much worse than the one in this movie, right? I mean, right?
(215_Made In U.S.A.) | This was very loosely based on an opera set in Paris, and moved to New York, right? Got anything where we go the other direction and take a hard-boiled novel in the U.S. and set it in Paris with some of the genders flipped?
(168_Mauvais Sang) | I love movies about blood-borne illnesses. Show me more!
*****************************
*****************************
005
Rock n Roll High School
(022_Dementia 13) | Got anything else produced by Roger Corman? He seems to pick winners!
(226_Bed and Board) | If Mama Ramone gave birth to another one, what should she name him? Is Alphonse too provincial? Should she call him Ghislain instead? Let's reason this out.
(035_Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life) | A Heroic Life) There's no way some dudes as funny looking as the Ramones would have gorgeous women swooning over them in real life, right? Right?
*****************************
*****************************
006
Parasite
(093_Handicapped Future) | Wow, poor people have it rough. How does it compare to having a disability though?
(139_Shivers) | Not bad, but got anything with actual parasites in it?
(049_Ivan's Childhood) | That kid was pretty stealthy! Bet his skills could have been applied pretty well in wartime...
*****************************
*****************************
007
Battleship Potemkin
(036_Grizzly Man) | So who would win in a fight--a detachment of dismounted Cossacks or an equal number of grizzly bears?
(041_Poison) | Okay, so now I have that "In the Navy" song by the Village People stuck in my head. Might as well roll with the homoeroticism...
(216_Antoine et Colette) | My attention span is still shot. Got anything else relatively short, preferably in black and white?
*****************************
*****************************
008
The Producers
(115_Red Army) | "Springtime for Hitler" is over. Is it hockey season yet?
(076_Crimes of the Future) | Fraud is kind of old fashioned for me. Show me the newest innovations in organ harvesting instead!
(024_Carol) | I think that Bialystock was onto something. Even some younger women can agree there's something appealing about older women!
*****************************
*****************************
009
Rabid
(157_Bob Le Flambeur) | It's probably best not to gamble with your health with untested treatments--or to gamble much at all, for that matter!
(230_Boyz n the Hood) | Sad that most people don't know, don't show, or don't care what's going on with mutagenic surgical technology these days...
(188_The Darjeeling Limited) | Wow, it's interesting how much a motorcycle accident can really mess someone up...
*****************************
*****************************
010
The Five Obstructions
(240_Day For Night) | Making a film is probably easy if no one is deliberately trying to make it tricky for you, right?
(250_Beware of a Holy Whore) | ...And it's nice to see how calm and collected filmmakers can be in the face of hardship!
(100_The White Diamond) | I suppose it's easier making a film than a blimp! 
*****************************
*****************************
011
Fitzcarraldo
(048_The Steamroller and the Violin) | Bet it would be easier to get that ship through the jungle if someone only had a steamroller!
(022_Dementia 13) | At least no one drowned in those rapids. Safe boating is no accident!
(106_Werner Herzog Short Films) | That was good but kind of long. Got anything by the same director, but maybe shorter?
*****************************
*****************************
012
My Best Fiend
(040_Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) | I'd love for someone to make a Klaus Kinski biopic with some old He-Man dolls. Got anything to tide me over until that happens?
(009_Rabid) | Good lord, what bit Klaus Kinski to make him such a nutcase?
(125_To Live and Die in LA) | I love Kinski's energy and impulsiveness. Too bad he never channeled that into being a federal agent and catching counterfeiters!
*****************************

013
L'Age d'Or
(224_Lola) | The stocking scene was weirdly hot for something this early. I'm in the mood to watch some cabaret dancers now...
(089_Ballad of the Little Soldier) | Call me a monster, but I kinda laughed at the part where the little kid got shot!
(213_The Decline of Western Civilization) | At the risk of sounding like a punk, FUCK the bourgeois virtues and outdated sexual mores of our society!
*****************************
*****************************
014
Un Chien Andalou
(130_Menace II Society) | This movie gives me the strange urge to watch 1990s hood films and early surrealist films in an endless loop for some reason!
(134_The Hudsucker Proxy) | This had some pretty intense imagery in it. Got anything a little lighter? You know...for kids!
(174_L'Insoumis) | Too much eyeball trauma! You know who's a little easier on the eyes--Alain Delon!
*****************************
*****************************
015
Enigma of Kaspar Hauser
(061_Heart of Glass) | The chicken hypnotizer was pretty cool. So what happens if you hypnotize actors instead of poultry?
(040_Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) | I'm a sucker for true stories with unhappy endings. Got anything like that where the actors are a bit more...plasti?
(175_Four Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle) | Based on my viewing of this film, the Great and Powerful AI Algorithm thinks I would enjoy more movies about the fragility of innocence in the face of a complex and sometimes deceptive world!
*****************************
*****************************
016
Nosferatu the Vampyre
(233_Pontypool) | Dracula is fine, but what really scares me is babbling zombies in a snowstorm!
(145_Black Orpheus) | The count was looking pretty pale and sickly. I bet a trip to Rio would do him some good!
(025_I'm Not There) | I love the part where the count looks at the crucifix and tells Jesus, "Do your early stuff!" Oh wait, that was a different film...
*****************************
*****************************
017
The Master
(154_Johnny Guitar) | Not enough strong female characters in this one. I want to see something where the women wear the pants!
(189_Une Femme Est Une Femme) | Meh. Needs more strippers!
(229_Love on the Run) | I do have a soft-spot for films that feature a pathetic man-child though...
*****************************
*****************************
018
Nimic
(099_Jag Mandir) | I greatly prefer the sitar to the cello...
(077_Paint Your Wagon) | It just goes to show that sometimes two spouses are better than one!
(160_Daisies) | That was alright, but now I'm in the mood for some hot girl-on-girl scissoring action!
*****************************
*****************************
019
Dottie Gets Spanked
(052_Flesh for Frankenstein) | Watching kinky stuff in your formative years can certainly warp your sexuality. Speaking of which...got any horror films with lots of full frontal nudity?
(131_Friday) | Nothing takes the sting out of corporal punishment like chasing it with some THC!
(113_Once Upon a Time in America) | That kid should have tried bringing Dottie a charlotte russe cake with whipped cream instead of his amateurish drawings if he really wanted to get her attention!
*****************************
*****************************
020
Putney Swope
(245_The Tin Drum) | I know I should probably watch The Hudsucker Proxy next, but we'll put that off for awhile. Show me something with weird little dwarves instead!
(002_Shutter Island) | Some of that jive talk was difficult for me to understand. Got anything where the characters are from somewhere people talk normal, like Boston?
(004_Rent) | Selling out is the worst thing someone can do. Stay bohemian! Fuck The Man!
*****************************
*****************************
021
Fata Morgana
(139_Shivers) | Such beautiful scenery. Makes me want to watch something where people vomit parasites that turn other people into rapists!
(241_Soapdish) | Fata Morgana would be a great name for a soap opera character! 
(011_Fitzcarraldo) | A bit dry for me. Got anything in a damper setting?
*****************************
*****************************
022
Dementia 13
(151_Vivre sa Vie) | "Fishy fishy in the brook, Daddy caught you, now you're a hook-er!"
(166_Hiroshima Mon Amour) | I feel like I should chase this with a doomed love story, but I'm going to need to ease into it with some gruesome atomic bomb aftermath footage!
(037_Woyzeck) | Poor Billy never had a chance. I bet joining the army and some dietary changes would have cured what ailed him!
*****************************
*****************************
023
Fast Company
(234_Wittgenstein) | Drag racing is fun to watch, but you know what else is a drag? Wittgenstein's views about the limits of language!
(114_Spring Breakers) | Got anything with more booze/tobacco/dope/pussy/cars? Feel free to throw in some guns as well!
(170_Wings of Desire) | Those racers must keep their guardian angels pretty busy!
*****************************
*****************************
024
Carol
(058_Un Flic) | Poor Carol. She just needed some good-looking guy like Alain Delon to sweep her off her feet.
(149_Jules et Jim) | ...or maybe two good-looking guys!
(104_Meeting Gorbachev) | ...or maybe just some pudgy Russian dude with a port-wine stain on his head!
*****************************
*****************************
025
I'm Not There
(166_Hiroshima Mon Amour) | I think it's safe to say a lot of Dylan's cynicism came from being a product of the atomic age!
(125_To Live and Die in LA) | He definitely changed his demeanor and appearance over the course of his career!
(246_Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) | "Sleep? aint sleepin'... Sleep's for dreamers. I haven't slept in thirty days, man. Takes a lot of medicine to keep up this pace."
*****************************
*****************************
026
Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans
(186_Rushmore) | A film about dirty cops is just screaming for someone to make a stage play out of it. Didn't someone do that with Serpico?
(024_Carol) | Nicolas Cage's quiet and understated performance in this makes me want to watch something by Cate Blanchett.
(161_Funeral Parade of Roses) | And the obvious Freudian aspects put me in the mood for something based on Oedipus Rex.
*****************************
*****************************
027
Le Samourai
(094_Huie's Sermon) | Whether it's Bushido or the Bible, a man's gotta have a code!
(213_The Decline of Western Civilization) | The samurai may be all gone, but Western Civilization's not looking so hot itself.
(154_Johnny Guitar) | Enough with the samurai cop stuff. Time for a good chick-flick!
*****************************
*****************************
028
Kamikaze 1989
(067_Where the Green Ants Dream) | Alcoholic cops are almost as bad as alcoholic pilots!
(138_Peeping Tom) | Just the right level of lurid...but could we ramp up the sincerity?
(103_Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices) | This is fine, but needs more madrigals!
*****************************
*****************************
029
Cecil B. Demented
(152_Contempt) | It's fun getting a look at all the drama behind the scenes when films are being made!
(218_SubUrbia) | Good to see talented people with ambition. Sad to think how many just hang out getting drunk around parking lots...
(127_King of New York) | How about something with a few more crimes but less of the filmmaking...
*****************************
*****************************
030
Ieri Oggi Domani
(137_Black Narcissus) | That poor kid never stood a chance at being chaste with Sophia Loren across the way from him. I wonder if nuns have it any easier...
(088_Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World) | Enough pretty Italians. Show me some pre-meltdown Elon Musk bragging about how he's going to send people to Mars!
(114_Spring Breakers) | I have no doubt that Sophia Loren would fill out a bikini nicely...
*****************************
*****************************
031
The Maid (2009)
(114_Spring Breakers) | Sometimes getting away for a bit on holiday is all it takes to change your life!
(212_Les Carabiniers) | Barring that, you could just stay home and look at postcards...
(054_A Cat In Paris) | Or become a cat burglar. Probably a more interesting career path than being a domestic servant!
*****************************
*****************************
032
Rodin
(189_Une Femme Est Une Femme) | Balzac was lucky to be around French-speaking people, considering that his name sounds like ball-sack in English. Speaking of which, got any French films that end on untranslatable puns?
(210_British Sounds) | I like all the artist model nudity, but what would be really cool is if someone read some feminist Marxist texts to accompany it!
(033_Eiffel) | Okay, the French had some pretty good sculptors, but how are they at engineering?
*****************************
*****************************
033
Eiffel
(002_Shutter Island) | Towers next to rivers are fine. But lighthouses next to the ocean are even cooler!
(017_The Master) | Sure, the French can build towers out of wrought iron. But can they build titties out of sand?
(190_The Grand Budapest Hotel) | This movie makes civil engineers look pretty glamorous. Got anything that does the same for concierges? 
*****************************
*****************************
034
Joan of Arc
(055_The Man Who Killed Don Quixote) | Joan's army was tough, but could they take on an actual full-sized Spanish windmill?
(182_Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles) | Joan was a great warrior and leader, but could she properly bread a veal cutlet?
(134_The Hudsucker Proxy) | Just goes to show that sometimes good things happen if you put someone young and inexperienced in charge of things!
*****************************
*****************************
035
Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life
(183_Julien Donkey-Boy) | Gotta admit I'm a sucker for a film with a funny-looking protagonist.
(146_Orpheus) | But sometimes it's great when the very gay director just uses the prettiest dude he could find!
(135_Metropolis) | Actually, I kinda feel like just putting a couple of Serge Gainsbourg albums on and listening to those for a few hours. Got any silent films I could watch while I do that?
*****************************
*****************************
036
Grizzly Man
(148_The 400 Blows) | Some boys are into grizzly bears. And some will nearly burn their houses down building a Balzac shrine in their bedroom. Consider me the latter type!
(239_Madame Bovary) | So, ladies, would you rather drink arsenic or get ripped to shreds by a bear? I'd probably go with the arsenic, myself.
(143_Cleo from 5 to 7) | At least a bear would be a nice distraction from awaiting scary medical test results...
*****************************
*****************************
037
Woyzeck
(211_Le Petit Soldat) | Well, when the army sucks, maybe deserting is a better option. 
(098_Into the Abyss) | Downer ending, but he would have been facing capital punishment anyway.
(242_Kika) | That pondside murder-suicide would have made great fodder for a television tabloid show, especially if someone showed up to film it live!
*****************************
*****************************
038
A Trip to the Moon
(182_Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles) | I'm more of a homebody, myself, aside from occasionally running short errands. And I work from home... 
(057_Cobra Verde) | Why be a visitor to the moon when you can go to Africa and overthrow a king?
(194_A Married Woman) | Flying around in planes and rockets is nice, but don't neglect your wife!
*****************************
*****************************
039
Haxan
(066_Signs of Life) | Bet those witches could put on a pretty bitchin' fireworks display if they started going stir crazy...
(007_Battleship Potemkin) | I've heard witches kill babies, but Cossacks will do the same thing if given a chance.
(105_The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft) | I guess burning witches is fine if you don't have the option of tossing them in a volcano.
*****************************
*****************************
040
Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story
(054_A Cat In Paris) | A slender gal like Karen would have made an awesome cat burglar!
(151_Vivre sa Vie) | A little too skinny for sex work though.
(047_The Baby) | Let's see something different. Barbie dolls are for babies...
*****************************
*****************************
041
Poison
(015_Enigma of Kaspar Hauser) | At least those prisoners had each other to keep themselves entertained. Solitary confinement can be pretty rough on a young man.
(245_The Tin Drum) | The kid flying away reminded me of Peter Pan. Let's watch that next--or the closest thing to it that you have, I guess...
(197_Moonrise Kingdom) | The pastoral scenes were nice, but those juvenile delinquents would be better suited for adventures in the wild if they had been doing boy scouting instead of committing crimes!
*****************************
*****************************
042
Monsieur Hulot's Holiday
(220_Les Cousins) | Too lighthearted! Show me something with more misery, preferably in a rural setting--with some possible incest thrown in!
(240_Day For Night) | Well, everything around that poor guy that could go wrong did go wrong. That'd be a disaster if he were a film director!
(153_La Chinoise) | Holidays are for the bourgeoisie! No time for that nonsense until after the Revolution comes!
*****************************
*****************************
043
Munchhausen
(042_Monsieur Hulot's Holiday) | Lots of adventures to be had when traveling! Even a short getaway can be packed with action and (mis)adventures!
(047_The Baby) | I'm a bigger fan of Munchhausen sydrome by proxy. Got anything with a baby in it?
(221_24 Hour Party People) | When you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend! 
*****************************
*****************************
044
Lynch/Oz
(150_Hitchcock/Truffaut) | I love films with a slash in the title! Show me more!

(058_Un Flic) | Let's follow the yellow brick road...and see if any cops tail us!
*****************************
*****************************

Titicut Follies
(069_Rescue Dawn) | Wow, conditions in that place weren't much better than in a POW camp!
(205_Two or Three Things I Know About Her) | 
(010_The Five Obstructions) | Pretty good talent show considering it was put on by nothing but inmates and staff. Some people can do great work when challenged by such limitations I guess...
*****************************
*****************************
046
The Bicycle Thief
(005_Rock n Roll High School) | This film taught me that stealing bicycles is rad! Show me some more fun activities for juvenile delinquents!
(052_Flesh for Frankenstein) | Antonio may have failed at being a provider for his wife and a role model for their son, but at least he's less disappointing than Frankenstein's monster!
(098_Into the Abyss) | Good thing they were in Italy and not Texas. There would have been no mercy, and some hangin' judge would have thrown the book at him...
*****************************
*****************************
047
The Baby
(098_Into the Abyss) | Any good social worker can tell you that's not a good environment for a baby. He'll be lucky if he doesn't grow up to end up on death row!
(242_Kika) | Adult babies are pretty transgressive, but I'm really in the mood for developmentally disabled porn star rapists!
(195_Pierrot Le Fou) | Isn't it a bit more normal for the person acting as babysitter to run off with the dad, not the kid?

Blood for Dracula
(205_Two or Three Things I Know About Her) | 
(005_Rock n Roll High School) | Dracula's groupies were pretty hot, but I wonder how they compare to women in thrall to the Ramones?
(012_My Best Fiend) | Udo Kier was probably a lot easier to work with when playing Dracula than Klaus Kinski was...
*****************************
*****************************
052
Flesh for Frankenstein
(172_Bottle Rocket) | Baron von Frankenstein had some pretty ambitious ideas. I love a man with a plan!
(124_Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) | It's always a good idea to keep it in the family I guess...
(238_Being Maria) | That Igor scene was pretty traumatic. If you got anything else like that to sit through, let's just get it out of the way now.
*****************************
*****************************
053
Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan
(090_Encounters at the End of the World) | Not enough tribbles! Could we maybe get something with penguins in it instead?

Kika
(188_The Darjeeling Limited) | The pervert sex maniac brother was a pretty extreme example, but it's pretty common to have difficult siblings...
