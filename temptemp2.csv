The actual documentary never got made, allegedly due to some combination of death threats and lawsuits by people who did not want this exposed.

The turkey guy, who really seems to enjoy shooting turkeys, is particularly memorable. Turkeys have been a meaningful part of your life at multiple points in your life. When you were a child you drew a lot of cartoon turkeys, with which you populated umerous childhood creative projects any time you were called upon to draw cartoons or illustrations. You had a particular character, Rheinhardt the Turkey Prince, who got to be the main character in a book when your third grade teacher made the more advanced reading students write and illustrate their own children's books in collaboration with the art teacher. (This slim volume may still exist somewhere in your mother's archives.) When you and your belated wife moved to the east coast, you started always celebrating Thanksgiving at home, and you always had a turkey or at least a cornish hen, no matter how inadequate your kitchen and oven seemed for the task. And when you were cruelly tossed back into the dating scene upon being widowed, you and a close female friend on the west coast (and thus a few hours behind you) initiated a sort of ritual called a \""giblet check\"" whenever you were out on a date or up to some other activity that seemed ominous--the grim joke being that you were going to wake up in a bathtub full of ice without one of your kidneys. She would insist that you text her at some point during the evening to let her know that your giblets were still intact and likely to stay that way. Knowing your dating history before your wife, she had diminished confidence that this would be the case. You appreciated having someone know where you were and what you were doing in return for getting the juicy details. And you certainly never hesitated to send her a message that she should check in on you later if things were looking hazardous for any reason, romantic or otherwise.

The second is the name, invoked here somewhat ironically, which leads a viewer now to thinking it will be a documentary about police corruption of police glorification instead of the rather mundane crime story about a senseless murder and a man who was wrongly convicted for it. The back story is even a bit more interesting than the story in the documentary itself, as well done as it is."", ""<P>"", ""You've long had an uncomfortable relationship with the police.

They had more reason to want to avoid them than you did, for various reasons, based on their own professions or backgrounds or skin colors or ethnic heritages."", ""<P>"", ""As a cabbie, you actually ended up having quite a bit of empathy for the police in some ways. You frequently dealt with the same kinds of people--rowdy drunks and criminals and druggies and other lowlifes--at all hours of the night.

As for the concept of a \""thin blue line\"", as vile as you found it, you could respect the sort of <I>esprit de corps</I> that police would demonstrate amongst each other for others who did the job. You saw the same thing in other groups you had exposure to. Literal soldiers and bartenders and strippers and criminals often had the same sort of bunker mentality when it came to circling the tents around outsiders, and cabbies certainly shared this mentality.

You were out there alone with just your wits and no weapon aside from a four-battery Maglite. If someone swore at you and threatened you or threw a punch, which frequently happened, there was very little chance they would face any punishment for it. And much of the time you were carrying a few hundred dollars of cash in your shirt pocket, which painted an enormous target on your head. Hearing police whine about how dangerous their jobs were and how justified they were in using force against some drunk who did nothing more than mouth off to them was laughable to you.

Burroughs reading selections from <I>Naked Lunch</I> and some other spoken word by trans-drag performer Justin Vivian Bond performing as Pantychrist.)
