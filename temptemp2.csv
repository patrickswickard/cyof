This worked just fine for you until you hit middle school, which was a bit like being thrown into General Population in a prison. Suddenly you found yourself in a different world. You went to the Wrong School for teachers to believe you were smart, so you weren't tracked into gifted classes despite having straight A's and high test scores. So you got to be a nerdy pussy around a bunch of much bigger and older and rougher kids who bullied the shit out of you.

At worst they'd also twist his nipples or grab his dick and balls or give him a spanking (or worse) until he cried like a baby, to everyone's great amusement.

He'd failed classes and was held back and he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but at least he had a sense of humor. You'd try to stick close to him since he was big enough for them not to fuck with, and he'd usually try to stop them from fucking with you too."", ""<P>"", ""You also started carrying a weapon of sorts to school. You were usually wary of bringing an actual knife for fear of being expelled or worse, although you fell back on this a few times when things looked dicey. You finally settled on bringing in a metal comb, a Hartz flea comb with a hard plastic handle, designed for combing vermin off of dogs. You wrapped the handle with black electrical tape to make the logo less noticeable, and the teachers thought nothing of it. Whenever it was time to change from your pants to your gym shorts, you would find that a convenient time to put your back against the lockers and \""comb your hair\"" so it was in your hand while you were at your most vulnerable."", ""<P>"", ""This precaution cut down dramatically on the number of times you got physically fucked with in the locker room at least. It also gave you a bit of protection on the bus home, which you had to share with actual high school kids, some of whom would regularly carry switchblades which they would sit and flick open and closed out of boredom."", ""<P>"", ""During this time you suddenly became depressed and moody, much to the puzzlement of your parents, who had trouble believing that school had gotten <I>that</I> much worse since their own school days and not reflecting that their social circumstances (e.g. having older siblings or going to a smaller school at the time) might be different from your own."", ""<P>"", ""After some further bullying incidents outside of school during the summer, something in you snapped a bit and you resolved to make things change. You started working out pretty aggressively around the time you were hitting puberty, doing push-ups and lifting weights with dumbbells every day three times a day. You lifted weights on machines whenever you could get into the gym as well. By the end of eighth grade you ended up putting on a good deal of muscle mass along with your growth spurt. Aside from being quite strong, you still weren't very athletic, and some of your classmates who previously had bullied you were disappointed you didn't want to be on the football team with them."", ""<P>"", ""By the time you graduated, you ended up being quite a bit larger than most of the kids who had bullied you in middle school.

When you lived in Milwaukee, you decided to read your way through every single Shakespeare work, partly as an effort to make up for your engineering-heavy undergraduate education that was rather light in the literature department. You knew that this was an endeavor that would both succeed and fail. The bible literature class that was forced on you in high school required you to read nearly the entirety of the Bible, which was a daunting task that raised more questions than answers.

Much of the film is the girls having bad dates and relationship problems, and it's not immediately obvious how much the audience is supposed to sympathize or care, and it's especially hard watching this later since even the more innocuous men are ultra-dickheads by today's standards. One of the quieter women has a mysterious suitor who keeps showing up on his motorbike. It almost seems like a relief when he whisks her away for what appears to be a sweet romantic encounter.

He tries his hand at being a night clerk in a hotel, a detective, a stock boy in a shoe store (as part of his undercover detective work), a TV repairman, etc. There are some good running gags and much of it is very funny.

As part of his counseling work, he had a contract with the county and/or state to go around to banks and other businesses after they had been robbed to talk to the employees and do an assessment to see who was in need of further counseling for potential PTSD after having a gun stuck in their face. He did a frightening amount of these--most such robberies do not make the news unless it's unavoidable. He couldn't directly tell you any of the stories about these--he was very scrupulous about this. But he was able to articulate the sheer range of human responses to this trauma. Many people took it in stride (at least at the time), some were shaken, some broke down and were a complete mess. He was sort of amazed how resilient people could be in the immediate aftermath of even a violent robbery, but he would note that even the ones who seemed fine might have it catch up with them later.

Someday a day may come where you have more patience for sitting and reading, but recent events have shattered your attention span so much that you're lucky to make it through a full two hour film or even a thirty minute television episode.

Part of this you attribute to a blindness caused by the presence of Penelope Cruz or (especially) Antonio Banderas in his films. Antonio Banderas is absurdly attractive to the point of nearly eclipsing anything weird in the film."", ""<P>"", ""Many of Almod\u00f3var's films remind you of going over to your gay and queer friends' houses when you were a kid and playing <I>wrong</I> with their Barbie dolls, a phenomenon that is doubtless covered elsewhere somewhere in these pages. Except in Almod\u00f3var's case, his Ken doll is literally the actor Antonio Banderas, whose career he is largely responsible for launching. And who is actually a pretty good actor! For many straight male film critics, Antonio Banderas seems to be dismissed as a pretty boy, a piece of eye candy for straight female audiences to drool over. And for many straight female film viewers this seems to be the case as well. But for you the best way to watch Antonio Banderas in one of Almod\u00f3var's films is to imagine him as a Ken doll who is not shut off from the gay male gaze. He's pretty for the boys too, and he's fine with that."", ""<P>"", ""This movie is what happens when you play wrong with your Barbies with a budget. And the Barbies are all bitchy and day drinking and drugging themselves and each other and one has a freaky Habsburg jaw and a bad attitude and the decision-making is absurd and terrible and they're all fucking each others' husbands and getting into absurd catfights and getting into chases on motorcycles borrowed from gender-appropriate G.I.

If the kid acts normal and wants to play boring-Barbie, then that's fine.

It's part of the absurd humor of the film. Again, as with many Almod\u00f3var films, you would argue that this film feels like someone playing \""wrong\"" with their Barbies. Abril's character is an actress and former porn star and she has a bit of an addiction to pain killers as well as a raging toothache throughout the film.

You were then forced to explain that no, while that was a valid concern, this particular piece of knotted rope was for the purpose of tying up your sex partner back in the happy days when she was still on speaking terms with you.

Pepi all-too-quickly figures out that Luci is rather sexually submissive and, hilariously, into water sports, so she pisses on her face in a scene best described as \""boy that escalated quickly\"".

It's sadly realistic for anyone who has dealt with the alien logic of how abuse and abusers work. Nearly every woman you've known who has escaped her abuser temporarily has either beelined back for more or sought out someone else who would immediately be an equal or greater problem for them. That's not a matter of victim blaming, but just a sad acknowledgment that getting out of a domestic abuse situation is only half the issue. Without treating the core issues that make them that way, prey will remain prey.
