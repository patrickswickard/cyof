You will watch most of this in a bar with a beer in front of you and no other substances in your body.
<P>
You don't have much of a reputation as a stoner, intentionally if not entirely fairly. You generally stick to beer and almost never mix-and-match.
<P>
While you are watching this, one of the kitchen staff of the bar who knows you pretty well will come up behind you, glance at your phone, and ask incredulously, "Are you watching <I>Friday</I>???"
<P>
There's little sense in spelling out your general philosophy on these matters when the Asylum Street Spankers already said it best (in another song you played frequently on your radio show):

Speed is a drag, it's a big big drag<BR>
Set your mind on fire, make your organs sag<BR>
Coke is a joke, rather take a toke<BR>
Than be broken and a choking with your brain cells smoking<BR>
Tripping on acid makes you flaccid, DMT too rich for me<BR>
Heroin, aquarium, a nice pine box to bury in<BR>
Marijuana makes me wanna eat candy and screw Madonna<BR>
With her hair bleached by peroxide, huffing on some nitrous oxide<BR>
I've tried them all and I'm might sound queer<BR>
But my favorite drug is a nice cold beer<BR>
Beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer<BR>
Beer beer beer beer, we love beer!<BR>

Oh...and for the record, this is the one with Ice Cube in it (as well as everyone else), and he's hilarious.
<P>
Bye, Felicia!
