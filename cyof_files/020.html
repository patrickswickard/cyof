<P>
You've been wanting to see this for years, but you have been thwarted at every opportunity. You recall it playing at the Maryland Film Festival (selected and introduced by electronic musician DJ Spooky no less), but it was either sold out or conflicted with another film you wanted to see. Similar conflicts blocked every chance you had to see it at some revival or other. You had (or are still having, depending on your previous choices) the same issue with <I>The Hudsucker Proxy</I>, which you know is related to this plot-wise.
<P>
Upon finally seeing it you are delighted by how crazy and goofily funny it is. It turns out to be well worth the wait. Parts of it remind you of beloved classics of your youth such as <I>Kentucky Fried Movie</I> and <I>Amazon Women on the Moon</I>. You should be informed that neither of these is on the list of films that your choices here will lead you to, but there's nothing saying you can't go watch either of those or clips from them right now. The theme song of the former is particularly good...
<P>
You walk away from this film strongly convinced that Robert Downey, Sr., should do voice-over work for more blaxploitation films. Or, if you happen to be reading this after July 7, 2021, should have done more voice-over work (spoiler alert), in which case you pour out a little bit of your Moroccan Mint tea in his honor.
