TITLE: Black Narcissus
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 137
<P>
This is a 1947 film about a bunch of horny nuns. It was done by the same director(s) as <I>The Red Shoes</I>. Like that film, you're going to easily get this mixed up with <I>Black Orpheus</I>, which is sort of the Orpheus story set at Brazilian Carnivale.
<P>
This film doesn't make a huge impression on you, but it does make you sad for one of your favorite old punk band shirts that you used to wear endlessly. You had a Black Flag shirt that was bright red and featured the album cover art for their album <I>Slip It In</I> which was designed by Raymond Pettibon. The shirt had a cartoon image of a nun wearing a habit, on her knees with her arm around the legs of a man who appears to be naked from the waist down. The text on the image read "Nobody knows more than I that the less girls know the better they are likely to be." It was one of your more provocative shirts, but you never caught any flak for wearing it, even when you went to work your shifts in the campus bookstore. (People seemed more upset about your blue hair when you had that, but that was another story.)
<P>
You never thought much about wearing the shirt until one day you were wearing it at the cash register and an actual nun in full habit, presumably from your "sister school" across town, walked into the bookstore while you were wearing it and you had to ring her up for a sale. You felt completely wracked with Catholic guilt, even though you did not grow up Catholic, but she didn't seem to be much bothered by that or your weird hair.
<P>
Years later one of your girlfriends would borrow this shirt from you, which was big and roomy enough for her to sleep in. She insisted she would give it back eventually, but never did. One night you dreamed that she had turned the shirt into a pink shirt featuring Care Bears through prolonged physical contact, and the two of you would refer to it henceforth as your "Care Bear shirt". Eventually you grew apart and it went to the same lost limbo as the many other hoodies and button downs and pairs of sweatpants that other girls had appropriated or stolen or borrowed over the years.
