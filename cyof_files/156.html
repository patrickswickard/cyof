TITLE: Rififi
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 156
<P>
This is a French heist film directed by Jules Dassin, who was actually a blacklisted American director. Dassin is the same guy who did <I>Topkapi</I> (which you would always get this confused with) and <I>Never on Sunday</I> (which you would not).
<P>
The schtick for this film is it has a nearly-silent half-hour heist in the middle of it--which is actually pretty well done. You're not surprised to find out that Melville was originally supposed to direct this, but he got plenty of other ones under his belt after this so no hard feelings. It also has a goofy theme song which was apparently only tacked on to explain the weird title, which makes you incapable of remembering any details of what this film is about later.
<P>
You were pretty sure you had the soundtrack to this as a vinyl album when you were a kid, but it was actually probably <I>Topkapi</I>. Or maybe you're confusing it with the soundtrack for <I>Hatari!</I>, which you definitely had because you remember frequently playing the merry-sounding "Baby Elephant Walk" by Henry Mancini. All these films seemed to have exotic soundtracks which endlessly amused our forebears, or at least your parents in particular, who handed these records down to you when you got your first turntable. This introduced you to a lot of music you had no business knowing or caring about as a child, and it set you up to become a disc jockey later in life.
<P>
Never on Sunday is also the name of a restaurant in your neighborhood. It's one of those Greek places that serves Greek food alongside every other food under the sun. One of those places that has a twelve page menu with almost anything you would ever want to order. To your frustration, nearly no one recognizes the name of the restaurant as signifying that it is a Greek restaurant. It used to be closed on Sundays, but now it is not. This upset literal-minded citizens of your neighborhood who have never heard of the film of the same name, and you've fruitlessly tried to explain this connection to many people only to be frustratingly disregarded.
