TITLE: Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 096
<P>
This is a Werner Herzog documentary film about Bruce Chatwin, a modern explorer of sorts. Apparently he wrote some book that never crossed your radar. The first part of this film deals with a pelt that Chatwin had, which was allegedly made of Brontosaurus skin. From there it meanders into topics such as the native religions in Australia and controversies over publishing songs and songlines used to navigate on that continent, and so on from there. It's an interesting meandering about a man you might otherwise struggle to care about.
<P>
Something in your currently beer-soaked brain as you watch this makes you marvel about Flintstones Vitamins. They always tasted to you like nutritious rocks, which apparently is the very definition of vitamins and minerals. You could imagine that everything in the Flintstones universe from Dino's pelt to the flesh of Fred would be covered in nutrient dust from when the world was new. Everything would smell and taste like the vitamins. We are all made of stardust, after all.
<P>
If you put a Flintstone vitamin under your tongue it is like letting the Lascaux cave paintings dissolve inside your mouth. It's the taste of a fat lip from a schoolyard fight. It's like putting a penny in your mouth because you are thirsty. It's like touching a nine volt battery to your tongue. It is the taste of power.
