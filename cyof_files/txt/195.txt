You're going to get your Godard's worth out of this film since it stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. He abandons his wife and kids and bourgeouis life to run off with Anna Karina's character, who is naturally being chased by crazed right-wing OAS terrorists. The two of them end up having a lot of bizarre surreal misadventures. They wreck cars and stab dwarves and get caught on a desert island and get waterboarded. Anna Karina's character ends up abandoning Jean-Paul Belmondo for her "brother", who turns out to be her actual boyfriend, and then he kills both of them. Then he paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up with dynamite, though he tries (unsuccessfully) to abandon this plan at the last minute. It's kind of like the film <I>Something Wild</I> mixed with a real-life Wile E. Coyote cartoon.

It's all pretty impressive as far as mid-life crises go. This is Godard at his loony best.
