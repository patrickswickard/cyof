TITLE: Two or Three Things I Know About Her
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 205
<P>
You can't go wrong with this film, with Godard directing and a budding romance between the ever-youthful Anna Karina and Heath Ledger playing high school students in a retelling of <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>. You're eager to see what Godard does with a Shakespeare play, since apparently he directed a version of <I>King Lear</I> as well, as you'll see in Section 204--one of the films on your watchlist you're most excited for!

Okay, so that was a lie about the Heath Ledger. And the Shakespeare. And the Anna Karina. You're probably getting this confused with something else. But it is indeed Godard being Godard. This is another lightly-plotted film with a bunch of EXPERIMENTAL plumage that's pretty and gets the job done well. It's sixties housewives being consumerist bourgeois prostitutes and other such statements with intertexts and close-ups of brassiere ads and fourth-wall-breaking interviews with the camera and other obnoxious shit that would fall apart immediately if Godard wasn't the cheeky monkey at the reins.
