<P>
Another Klaus Kinski film by Werner Herzog. This one is short and "sweet", at least for that pairing, though it ultimately ends in tragedy. Kinski gets to play a mentally unstable soldier who is on an all-pea diet, which doesn't sound like it would be good for you. Here he looks pale and miserable and malnourished, and he ends up being cuckolded by a drum major to boot.

You like peas, but not enough to eat them exclusively. It was a household joke that your spouse would often add peas to macaroni and cheese so you could savor "that fresh pea taste". But too much of anything, whether alcohol or peas, can lead to madness. Orson Welles' notorious pea adverts are a testament to this fact.

You always try to keep at least one can of peas on hand so that, if pressed, you can make some kind of Olivye salad. A Russian ex-girlfriend introduced you to this culinary delight, but seemed displeased when you learned to make it yourself and were no longer dependent on her to supply it to you. The version you would always make required a couple of potatoes, a nearly equal but slightly smaller amount of carrots, a few hard-boiled eggs (about the same amount as the carrots), some dill pickles, a can of peas, some mayonnaise, and some fresh chopped dill and salt and pepper to taste. You cut up the potatoes and carrots into cubes roughly the size of the peas and boil them until they are slightly soft but not falling apart. Then you cut up the hard-boiled eggs and the dill pickles, again keeping them in cubes about the same size as the peas. You then make a potato salad out of this by mixing the mayo with the dill and salt and pepper and then stirring in the other ingredients, adding the more fragile ones last and garnishing with any leftover dill. A delicious Soviet treat!

This film also contains the most beautiful bedtime story of all time, as immortalized by Tom Waits:
<P>
<I>
Once upon a time, there was a poor child<BR>
With no father and no mother.<BR>
And everything was dead,<BR>
And no one was left in the whole world.<BR>
Everything was dead.<BR>
<BR>
And the child went and searched day and night,<BR>
And since nobody was left on the earth<BR>
He wanted to go up in to the heavens.<BR>
And the moon was looking at him so friendly.<BR>
And when he finally got to the moon,<BR>
The moon was a piece of rotten wood.<BR>
<BR>
And then he went to the sun.<BR>
And when he got there,<BR>
The sun was a wilted sunflower.<BR>
<BR>
And when he got to the stars,<BR>
They were little golden flies, stuck up there<BR>
Like the shrike sticks â€˜em on a black thorn.<BR>
<BR>
And when he wanted to go back down to Earth,<BR>
The Earth was an overturned piss-pot.<BR>
<BR>
And he was all alone.<BR>
<BR>
And he sat down and he cried.<BR>
And he is there to this day.<BR>
<BR>
All alone.<BR>
