TITLE: British Sounds
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 210
<P>
Finally, some <I>noise</I>! You're going to fall in love with the way this film sounds after the first ten minutes in a factory. This makes you want to pause the film and listen to a Judas Priest album to warm up and then restart just to listen to the <I>metal</I>. Hypnotic factory noises with occasional readings from <I>The Communist Manifesto</I>. A naked woman on screen (again you had to bring your laptop to the coffee shop...) while someone reads political tracts. A television news reader reads an old-school right-wing reactionary tract ranting about communists and socialists ruining the world. Then we get some cringey Beatles parodies, turning them into filk songs from someone's labor solidarity meetup. And finally we get the closing image of a few minutes of <I>fists punching through a bunch of Union Jacks</I>. Fuck yeah! You're ready to put the vegan Docs in your closet that you never quite finished breaking in back on your feet and then go start an Oi band after watching this. Let's go find the asshole that sprayed NF propaganda shit from a stencil onto your back alley and give him a good stiff kick in the yarbles!
<P>
Fifty-four minutes this would have been if you didn't replay the beginning part a few times for emphasis while on an exercise bike. (This is a <I>great</I> film if you want to pedal furiously for forty-five minutes and then cool down.)
