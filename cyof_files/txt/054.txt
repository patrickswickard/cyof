TITLE: A Cat In Paris
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 054
<P>
You like cats. You like Paris. You like hand-drawn animation. None of those facts makes you like this animated film as much as you thought you would. It has its moments, but the plot isn't meaty enough to really hold your attention. It's not terrible, it's just kind of blah.
<P>
Some of your favorite animations have been about cats. You particularly enjoyed the Garfield and Heathcliff cartoons when you were a kid. No one can take this away from you, not even the live action abominations from recent years have spoiled that enjoyment for you. The cartoons were well-scripted and well-voiced, and even the spinoff characters from <I>U.S. Acres</I> and <I>The Cat-illac Cats</I>expanded the world in welcome ways.
<P>
You've been both baffled and entertained by the increasingly surreal and deranged takeoffs on both of these properties. Garfield eventually spawned some philosophical absurdities such as <I>Garfield without Garfield</I>, which mostly consist of Jon Arbuckle talking to himself. There are also the beautifully grotesque Fatal Farms videos from Youtube, which re-enact a Garfield strip followed by a music video for some famous popular song based on the imagery from the strip. You also know (not firsthand) of a local dominatrix, very likely solidly "on the spectrum" who considers herself a Garfield domme and has produced at least one crude Garfield computer dating simulator in which you are supposed to romance Garfied.
<P>
The latest development in this tradition is the latest conceptual intellectual property abuse of the <I>Heathcliff</I> daily strips in the newspaper. <I>Heathcliff</I> has now degenerated into a series of opaque in-jokes involving his fixation on meat and driving hams around town and a bubble gum that can lift him into the sky when he blows bubbles. These in-jokes are beaten like a drum to the point of not being even mildly funny but also conceptually hilarious to the point where you feel forced to laugh rather than complain because of the very absurdity. It's a neverending brick joke that makes you a fool for laughing too soon or too late or thinking about it too hard.
