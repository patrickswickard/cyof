<P>
This is essentially Yorgos Lanthimos' first film. It's a strange one and it's going to be hard to sit through even though it's only 95 minutes. It sounds better in theory than in practice, though it has its moments. The central theme is that three apparent strangers--a cop, a photographer, and a hotel maid--keep getting together to recreate murder scenes in a seemingly ritualistic manner for unexplained reasons.
