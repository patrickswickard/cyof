TITLE: A Trip to the Moon
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 038
<P>
This film reminds you of the greatest children's bedtime story of all time. This was featured in the film <I>Woyzeck</I>, which you encountered back in Section 37 (or will encounter eventually) and which was also immortalized by Tom Waits:
<P>
<I>
Once upon a time, there was a poor child<BR>
With no father and no mother.<BR>
And everything was dead,<BR>
And no one was left in the whole world.<BR>
Everything was dead.<BR>
<BR>
And the child went and searched day and night,<BR>
And since nobody was left on the earth<BR>
He wanted to go up in to the heavens.<BR>
And the moon was looking at him so friendly.<BR>
And when he finally got to the moon,<BR>
The moon was a piece of rotten wood.<BR>
<BR>
And then he went to the sun.<BR>
And when he got there,<BR>
The sun was a wilted sunflower.<BR>
<BR>
And when he got to the stars,<BR>
They were little golden flies, stuck up there<BR>
Like the shrike sticks â€˜em on a black thorn.<BR>
<BR>
And when he wanted to go back down to Earth,<BR>
The Earth was an overturned piss-pot.<BR>
<BR>
And he was all alone.<BR>
<BR>
And he sat down and he cried.<BR>
And he is there to this day.<BR>
<BR>
All alone.<BR>
</I>
