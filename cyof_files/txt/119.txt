TITLE: Everything Everywhere All At Once
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 119
<P>
This is a very quirky film and you're not sure how to feel about it. The first half hour seems like a pretty straightforward indie film about the immigrant experience through the seldom-seen lens of a frumpy middle-aged Asian woman. The film utterly nails that section of the film. Then the wheels come off and it's a wild, wild ride. It's weird fun in a way that makes it seem like two separate movies, and it's maybe a bit too much for you to fully enjoy the full sensory onslaught of it all.
<P>
This is a good movie for when you're in the mood to watch a slow burn indie film about the Asian-American experience but you also need some loud, vulgar, insane kung-fu stuff thrown in.

Jamie Lee Curtis plays Carol Burnett playing a tax accountant auditor who can do martial arts and sometimes has erotic sausage fingers.

The film embraces the absurd and if you're in the right mood it will hit you just right and be the best thing you've ever seen. If you are in the wrong mood then you will be enormously frustrated one way or another for great stretches of the film.

There is a literal Everything bagel at the center of this film. This will make you feel sad and nostalgic and hungry. You haven't had a <I>great</I> real everything bagel with lox spread from New York since before the pandemic, and you haven't even had a decent everything bagel since before your wife passed away. During the pandemic she would sometimes mask up and get breakfast at the Russian deli around the corner from your apartment for you. You have not had the heart to do this since she left this world.
