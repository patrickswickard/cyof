TITLE: Frances Ha
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 132
<P>
This film is for a girl who lost her script<BR>
Wandering through a world devoid of color<BR>
Mumbling lines into an offscreen mic<BR>
Still matching wits with all the pretty boys<BR>
As if she were a Shakespeare heroine<BR>
Declared a clever girl and patted on the head<BR>
A tame velociraptor kept for show<BR>
Not knowing which way she should prance offstage<BR>
She sprints through New York like Denis Lavant<BR>
On squandered money and on borrowed time<BR>
Bowie soundtrack blasting in her head<BR>
A reckoning awaits her but for now<BR>
She's free to seek her soul<BR>
And scratch part of her name<BR>
Onto a tiny mailbox<BR>
Hoping to be found<BR>
<P>
