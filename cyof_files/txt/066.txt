TITLE: Signs of Life
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 066
<P>
This is the Herzog film that features a protagonist by the name of Stroszek but isn't the Herzog film from Section 59 with the title <I>Stroszek</I> featuring a protagonist with the same name played by that weird little guy, Bruno S. Once again, as you will learn or have learned in other sections, it is important to keep your Herzog films stored in tightly sealed individual containers so that they don't leak into each other--and yes, this goes for the documentaries as well.

In this film Stroszek is one of three German soldiers tasked with guarding a dump site of unusable munitions in a small fort on a Greek island.
