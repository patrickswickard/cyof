This film is also known as <I>Sympathy for the Devil</I>, and it's essentially a documentary film by Jean-Luc Godard that captures the Rolling Stones composing their song, "Sympathy for the Devil". Being Godard, of course, it's not a straight-up documentary and there are several other staged and mostly irrelevant scenes included as well, including some weird shots of the Black Panthers reading from revolutionary texts with a bunch of captive women being dragged off to be shot, or a porn shop with a bunch of Nazi literature on display. And there's a woman whose character is credited as Eve Democracy in one particularly heavy-handed statement.

This is a more...bizarre...version of that ever popular music documentary where you get to "sit in on the sessions" and hear early versions of some song that will later become a huge hit. It's the kind of music which, as a guy, you can force a woman to listen to and elbow her in the ribs and tell her "Whoa, hey listen to that, that's the riff from such-and-such song!!!" to which they are obliged to giggle and acknowledge what an expert you are on music while you quote a few facts about Bob Dylan that you learned from a <I>33 1/3</I> book you perused during a long session at the bookstore.
<P>
Speaking of which, whoa! This film was being filmed and the eponymous song was being written during the period when Papa Brainworm RFK Sr. himself was assassinated, so you can hear when they were in the process of writing the song and they changed the line about "...who killed John Kennedy" to the line "...who killed the Kennedys". Isn't that wild, bro?
