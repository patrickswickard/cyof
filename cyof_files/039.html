TITLE: Haxan
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 039
<P>
This film is about witches. Silent ones, rendered in black and white. No Shakespearean lines pour forth from their mouths, and if their skin is green you wouldn't know.
<P>
It reminds you of one of your earliest existing poems (written roughly 21 years ago this week, depending on how far in the future you are reading this), archived somewhere in the dregs of your Hotmail account, which you got bored at work and dashed off and sent to your Wiccan ex-girlfriend. The poem deals with the comic strip character Broom Hilda in the first stanza, the Michelin Man in the second, and the Kool-Aid Man in the third--all sinister apparitions which scared you in your childhood. There's no better place to put this poem than here, so read it again for the first time. You never thought up a proper title for this one, so we'll just call it "Childhood Nemeses":

I<BR>
<BR>
the wart scared me the least<BR>
squatting on her bulbous nose<BR>
ugly but not sinister<BR>
her hair limp and stringy<BR>
drooped in thin lines<BR>
from under a crumpled black hat<BR>
flower perched on top<BR>
her eyes could hold a glint of tenderness<BR>
when they weren't fierce and angular<BR>
brows drawn into a disapproving V<BR>
and even her green skin was white on weekdays<BR>
the mouth is what would wake me up<BR>
too large and dark and full of rounded teeth<BR>
flashing at me over steaming cauldrons<BR>
<BR>
II<BR>
<BR>
bibendum<BR>
his name was latin<BR>
nunc est bibendum<BR>
now is the time to drink<BR>
but to me he was a fat mummy<BR>
who ate children<BR>
i wondered where the valve stems were<BR>
on the stack of pale tires that formed him<BR>
and how he'd look deflated<BR>
<BR>
i wasn't going down without a fight<BR>
<BR>
III<BR>
<BR>
the anticipation was the worst<BR>
for a heartbeat there was nothing but the wall<BR>
and even with the sound down<BR>
you knew what was coming<BR>
real glass would shatter on the bricks<BR>
even wolf's breath doesn't knock those down<BR>
i hoped i'd be struck dead by the debris<BR>
before he got too close<BR>
i could tell the smile was just a lie<BR>
