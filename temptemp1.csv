In one of the jokes on it, he suggests that a good prank to play when you are around children is to talk \""wrong\"". The audience laughs knowingly, believing he's suggesting teaching children how to swear in a particularly filthy manner. However the joke takes an absurdist left turn when he imagines the child's first day at school where he raises his hand and asks the teacher, \""May I mambo dogface to the banana patch?\"" This film is as if someone made this entire concept into a movie."", ""<P>"", ""You reflect on your own childhood, which as an adult you realize after the fact contained a lot of strange experiences and circumstances that you never realized were not normal for other people. Every TV family's home and situation looked a little bit alien and strange to you, and as a small child it was difficult to tell what was supposed to be considered \""normal\"". All the possibilities for how you might live as an adult seemed dizzying, and you imagined you could pick and choose between the aspects you liked. Maybe a Diff'rent Strokes apartment with some PeeWee's Playhouse vibes, or a somewhat less kooky Addams Family Victorian located in a sufficiently large city to keep you entertained. You never liked it much when your father's rovings would land him out in the boring suburbs away from the action."", ""<P>"", ""The dental horror in this one is enough to make you turn your head away squeamishly. You can almost taste the blood in your mouth during the worst scene of this."", ""<P>"", ""And all in all you are glad that you grew up as an only child. This movie does nothing to make you feel any different about that.""]"

Your own accent is heavily colored by Indianapolis and Chicago, with a few lengthy passes through Wisconsin. You've had several friends from Boston with particularly obnoxious Boston accents to match. One was a phone sex operator (a platonic friend--you never utilized her services) who was a rather attractive woman. But on the phone she would often pretend to be anything but this. She specialized in \""granny\"" calls where she would pretend to be a feeble old woman, or mommy-domme calls where she would angrily humiliate and discipline adult babies, acting as though she were their strict mother. All this was done without dropping her horrifyingly thick Boston accent, apparently."", ""<P>"", ""You shudder at the action on the screen and imagine how uncomfortable it must be to be running around a storm like that in wet socks.""]"

You always preferred malts yourself, which always had a more interesting flavor profile than shakes. It was like drinking crushed Whoppers, the little chocolate ball treats that came in the milk containers. You remember the perennial MTV hippie presidential candidate Randee (with two e's like the river) of the Redwoods professing to this same preference in his campaign song, \""Either Way It's Fine With Me\"" (\""It's my motto, and it gets me out of a lotta mental jams!\"") Randee taught you that it's fine to be chill about things that don't matter much in the grand scheme of things, or things that are beyond your immediate control."", ""<P>"", ""You wonder if there is anywhere in Baltimore you could get a malt at this hour. There used to be a frozen yogurt place near your apartment, but that closed long before the pandemic and was never open quite late enough anyway. You can feel the absence of butterscotch in your mouth at the thought. It was always a reliable place to get a few ounces of fro-yo (often taro-flavored) chased by some absurd amount of toppings, pretending these were locked up overnight in some utterly secure roach-free container. The same sort of presumed anti-roach faraday cage you pretend the water ice/snowball/sno-cone stoop vendors have in their basement to keep the vermin away from their syrups."", ""<P>"", ""You might be able to get a chocolate egg cream somewhere, though that's more of a New York City thing. Sometimes the Jewish delis have that. You suddenly have an urge for a cucumber-flavored soda as well."", ""<P>"", ""You realize you haven't eaten for a few days. You've been too busy watching movies. You also realize at the climax how bad you are at bowling. You rolled a 27 after Prom, which was disheartening enough to make you give up on the sport. Theoretically you should be pretty good at it, since you have plenty of upper body strength. It occurs to you that your technique is probably significantly flawed. You're strong enough to try to treat a bowling ball as a projectile rather than firmly rolling it, but not quite strong enough for that to actually work. Maybe you should have taken up shot put instead."", ""<P>"", ""You wonder if you could dodge a bowling ball. ""]"

You have never properly internalized this number since, as a mathematician, it is something you can calculate on the fly if the need ever arises."", ""<P>"", ""As an opera-lover, you are slightly charmed that someone decided to do a musical theater version of La Boheme, but that too is ultimately a bit distracting. You find yourself trying to map the principal characters of Rent onto the ones in La Boheme and then confusing yourself, awaiting references that never materialize. What's worse, you find some of the actual references to the music in the original confusing and off-putting. Using Musetta's Waltz in anything but an at least slightly comic sense is very jarring. It's as if watching someone singing a serious aria to the tune of \""Yakety Sax\"" from Benny Hill."", ""<P>"", ""You buckle in and try to enjoy the musical. People start mooing for the performance artist and you're distracted again. Some of the spoiled, entitled artist stuff hits close to home and you alternate between finding things extremely funny, extremely identifiable, or extremely annoying, depending on the scene. The love-hate evens out in the wash in the end, and you imagine your experience watching this leaves you with roughly the same affection or annoyance that an opera-deaf person with little exposure to performance artists and theater people would have upon seeing this."", ""<P>"", ""You think fondly back on the performance artist you took to her first opera when you worked for the radio station and had a plus-one along with your own free ticket. She was a classically trained singer and occasionally made operatic vocals part of her act. You initially can't remember if it was Tosca or Il Trovatore. Upon further reflection you recall it was Il Trovatore, since you remember how you both involuntary laughed out loud at the reveal at the end that the troubador and the count were actually long lost brothers, since one was played by an African-American baritone and the other by a Korean tenor who bore little familial resemblance to say the least. Afterwards she toured the country in a van shaped like a tea cup."", ""<P>"", ""You remind yourself that much of this film had the original theatrical cast, and that some of the annoyances you have are from questionable cinematography decisions, which is nearly always an issue when committing musicals to film. You can find enough love within yourself to overcome some of your annoyance.""]"

They are met and occasionally exceeded."", ""<P>"", ""This was another one that always dwelt in the blind spot in your cultural knowledge. You were familiar with the Ramones' entire catalog long before you had any chance to see this film. You always liked the Ramones, but something about them and people's reactions to them always made you queasy. It always felt like the Ramones slipped into a cultural role previously played by Sha-Na-Na. And part of their appeal seemed reactionary, like a throwback to the good old days of just plain rock 'n roll without all this other nonsense. Their leather jacket clowning felt safe enough for the squares to consume since they never dug too deep into the catalog or listened too close to the music. For the average square, they may as well have been four idiots in leather jackets doing really fast covers of their favorite 1950s songs, which admittedly forms a good bit of their catalog. Any subversive shit about sniffing glue or joining the SLA or being a male hustler at a notorious and now-gentrified NYC intersection was not getting clocked by someone just showing up to see the clown princes of Punk Rock do their schtick while the crowd awkwardly pogoed. It sometimes felt like you were watching a particularly vicious trained seal balance a ball on the tip of its nose."", ""<P>"", ""You feel like a hipster douchebag gatekeeper for being mad that other people love a band you love \""the wrong way\"". You try to shrug off the feeling."", ""<P>"", ""You like Paul Bartel. You like Mary Woronov. You bathe in their love and feel your attitude lightening. Good intentions and good vibes go a long way.

One of your friends when you drove cab lived in a particularly horrifying basement apartment that flooded frequently. Sometimes you and other drivers would end up in his pathetic dwelling as a sort of afterbar. It usually smelled at least somewhat funky--this was not a finished basement. And after one particularly bad flood it became particularly off-putting. He had spread a lot of soggy newspapers on the floor--copies of the free local weekly he had taken from one of the machines around town--and never picked them up. Much of the water was absorbed but still locked in the apartment within their filthy, reeking, stuck-together pages. He'd pass around a handle of vodka to help keep the sobriety away until the sun rose and then offer you whatever snacks or illicit substances he may have laying around. You usually declined, but your less-choosy friends would frequently indulge and listen to him telling stories about the glory days and bemoan losing his license. You were thankful for your thick boots as you squished and squelched your way around his hovel. He was a playwright, and unlike a lot of playwrights he actually possessed enough dynamic energy to will his productions into a brief life on stage in front of semi-enthusiastic audiences. He was also a widower--his wife had suicided in a particularly horrifying manner, which he would sometimes talk about when he got a few drinks in him. He had also lost his son-in-law on 9/11. They would occasionally trot him out for this fact at various memorials, even though he seemed to be estranged from much of his family including his children."", ""<P>"", ""The thought of all this depresses you a bit and gives you a little more sympathy for the impoverished Korean family as their travails play out on the screen before you.""]"

The meat that could \""crawl overboard on its own\""."", ""<P>"", ""You have a natural horror of maggots and vermin. Virtually all of your dreams feature maggots at some point, whether they are horrifying nightmares or fairly innocuous dreams. Whenever you close your eyes to sleep you're a little bit worried that maggots or other parasitic worms will make an appearance. Usually you are just trying to step carefully to avoid putting your foot into a writhing mass of them. Even a good thick pair of boots isn't going to make you feel good about that occurrence. Maggots in your food is even worse. More than once have you cracked open a raw walnut only to be greeted by a wriggling lot of very non-neotenous baby insects, which made you question every time you popped a roasted nut into your mouth without looking and found yourself greeted by a very \""off\"" flavor."", ""<P>"", ""The officer in the scene doesn't see the maggots until he uses his eyeglasses. As someone who is rather farsighted, this makes the horror worse for you. It also doesn't help that he shrugs and tells them \""It's only maggots, just soak the meat in brine\"". You remember all the times your grandmother would take you foraging for mushrooms in the woods, a task which you were nearly useless at. She would effortlessly find heaps of them which she would gather into a bread bag and throw the phallic little treats (\""peckerheads\"" as everyone referred to them) into salty water to \""get the bugs out\"". They were tasty enough that you tried not to think about it after they were pan fried in some butter or oil and sprinkled with a bit more salt."", ""<P>"", ""You always had a problem as well eating outdoors at picnics or family reunions. Watching flies land and crawl around on people's partially or fully-uncovered dishes would give you shivers. And on more than one occasion have you been greeted by actual fly-blown meat at such a gathering--always for food outside of your immediate control. Feeling morbid, you google the life cycle of flies and discover that it typically takes 12-24 hours for fly eggs to hatch into maggots for most species. This makes you wonder about the exact biological circumstances under which you observed this phenomenon and the cleanliness of the homes in which these meals were prepared for any of those picnic hellscapes you have attended."", ""<P>"", ""You take some comfort in the fact that any flies hatched in this film have likely been dead for over a century.

7,"[""TITLE: The Producers"", ""TEXT PLACEHOLDER 008"", ""<P>"", ""This film gives you happy memories of recording Doctor Demento radio shows off the radio onto cassette tape during your pre-teen years, a trait which you shared with your grad school roommate. You shrug off the memory before it gets too corny and reminds you too much of one of the Gen X Funnies Memes pages mercilessly force-fed to you by social media. But at some point you did record the notorious \""Springtime for Hitler\"" song from the radio, only vaguely being aware of the existence of this film."", ""<P>"", ""You think of the time you and your roommate took a road trip to Oshkosh, a pilgrimage to see a rare public appearance by Doctor Demento. He did not disappoint, but the crowd was somewhat horrifying. This was in the days where you could still be picky, and embracing others within your particular niche fandom didn't feel nearly as obligatory. You and your roommate engaged in a rather cruel-feeling game upon seeing the various weirdos and misfits in the crowd, a game would occasionally play together on the bus or in other public places where you were bored and surrounded by people you didn't necessarily want to be around. The game was called \""I'm Glad I'm Not That Person\"". You would simply point out a person and declare, \""I'm glad I'm not that person\"". You initiated this game while waiting for Doctor Demento to take the stage. The crowd of poor cosplayers and furries and nerds and other misfits present made this feel like shooting fish in a barrel. At one point you thought you had won the game by pointing out a man who looked (quite unintentionally) like an extremely hygiene-challenged doppelganger of Weird Al, wearing a filthy Hawaiian shirt and sporting an unironic mullet and facial hair. Your roommate then pointed out the man's romantic partner and declared \""I\""m glad I'm not that person\"" and won the game forever."", ""<P>"", ""The gleeful comical Nazis in this film remind you of the gleeful serious Nazis of today who didn't exist at the time--or at least were much more shunned. You feel a bit saddened at the thought of this and guilty for even playing the previously-described game, since there are obviously worse things than being cringey. Much, much worse.

It reminds you of other oddly appropriate doctor names you've run across. There were the usual ones, things like Dr. Payne or Dr. Hurt, all mild chuckle-fodder for Jay Leno. But there were still better ones. One of the dentists in a city you used to live in was named Marmar Miar, and it occurred to you that you would still be able to say her name while she had her fingers in your mouth. Another gynecologist in your hometown had the name Dr. Ho. This came to your attention when your hometown newspaper had a one-off section as a fundraiser where they allowed children to illustrate ads for local businesses. You recall that Dr. Ho's ad featured a crude drawing of a doctor along with the slogan \""If you hurt your toe, go see Dr. Ho\"" by a child who clearly was not briefed on what a gynecologist's specialty actually entailed. Yet another had the unfortunate name Dr. Franklin Stein, as it was printed on a check you processed when you were volunteering doing data entry for a local nonprofit."", ""<P>"", ""You've always had a soft spot for David Cronenberg, who you mentally credit with directing many of your dreams and nightmares, for better or for worse.

You sympathize with the cruelest obstruction of all--complete freedom--which is actually done as punishment for \""failing\"" one of the tasks. This makes you laugh bitterly, as you've always found a blank page to be the most intimidating restriction of all for your own attempts at artistic endeavors. For most of your own projects, you've usually set for yourself some kind of bizarre restriction.

The main character was a rather meek, skinny nerd who was barely tolerating the other young man, who was the campus pariah, who provided an idiotic running commentary about what was unfolding on the TV screen. The main character holds his emotions in check as long as he can before exploding in a burst of impotent rage at his fellow viewer. He feels a rush at the joy of finally asserting himself, but this is quickly ruined. The pariah finds his outburst hilarious and absurd and mocks him for his sudden display of emotion. The protagonist ultimately slinks away feeling devastatingly ashamed and humiliated."", ""<P>"", ""It should be noted that this story was not at all autobiographical, though it was inspired by real people.
